<p>The <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/orion/">Eclipse Orion</a> team has incrementally improved their web-based embeddable editor since last time when <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2013/03/Eclipse-Orion-2">we covered it on InfoQ a year ago</a>. Although it has&nbsp;incipient support for editing various languages, Orion is meant to be firstly an online editor for web technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript, providing syntax highlighting, validation and content assist and outline.</p>
<p>Orion 5 has a new look and feel, exchanging the Action and Navigation buttons with a new left-hand Navigation bar, traditional menus and context menus, the latter containing the most frequent commands. The content assisting functionality, which is a must-have feature for most&nbsp;developers, has been made faster, a bit more easier to use and it is using a different style compared to previous versions.</p>
<p>Syntax validation for JavaScript in Orion 5 is done via <a href="https://github.com/eslint/eslint">ESLint</a>&nbsp;with the exception of the HTML &lt;script&gt; tag. The team has switched from JSLint to ESLint due to its configurability, which in turn allows the end user to decide how the editor marks validation issues&nbsp;– Ignore, Warning, Error.&nbsp;The editor&nbsp;now does syntax validation for JSON files.</p>
<p>Orion 5 has also introduced a new syntax highlighting mechanism, adding support for a number of languages beside the traditional web ones:&nbsp;JSON, XML,&nbsp;Java, PHP, Python, Ruby, and YAML. Support for other languages can be included through the plug-in mechanism used.</p>
<p>Orion 5 includes content assist for several&nbsp;Node.js libraries, for several databases - Redis, MySQL, Postgres, MongoDB&nbsp;–, for the AMQP library, and Express.js framework. Other libraries can be indexed using Orion’s plug-in mechanism.</p>
<p>An interesting addition to Orion 5 is the ability to deploy a project on a PaaS using the <a href="http://docs.cloudfoundry.com/docs/reference/cc-api.html">Cloud Foundry API</a>.</p>
<p>Orion 4, released in November last year, introduced <a href="http://planetorion.org/news/2013/09/orion-4-0-m2-new-and-noteworthy/">a number of smaller enhancements</a>, including: the Project concept, support for Markdown documents, bracket completion, smart indent, customized editor rulers, support for IE8, and others.</p>
<p>Eclipse Orion can also be installed locally, being based&nbsp;on <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/orion">Node.js</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/connect">connect</a>, an HTTP server framework for Node.js. This local version provides support for file editing, basic file management, extension via plug-ins, client caching for static content, a shell, and gzip compression.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br></body></html>
