Terracotta recently announced the release of the new version of in-memory data platform <a href="http://terracotta.org/news/press-releases/2013/2013-03-04-terracotta-bigmemory-4-0-delivers-up-to-60-percent-faster-access-to-big-data">BigMemory</a> and the <a href="http://terracotta.org/news/press-releases/2013/2013-03-04-terracotta-announces-in-genius">new product In-Genius</a>, an in-memory intelligence platform for Big Data. The In-Genius platform will integrate messaging and event stream processing of data from different data sources to gather and act upon streaming or complex events for reporting, analysis and real-time response. The Big Data sources include real-time data not only to and from traditional desktop and laptop computers, but also from mobile devices such as smart phones, tablets, and point-of-sale (PoS) terminals.</p> 
<p><strong>BigMemory 4.0:<br /> </strong>The new BigMemory 4.0 in-memory data platform can be used by IT organizations to move their data into memory for speed and scale without the costly and complicated data management approaches. The new version supports&nbsp;<a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop</a> integration allowing for movement of in-memory data and insights between BigMemory and Hadoop for real-time enterprise intelligence.&nbsp;Other improvements in the latest version include Search of in-memory data sets is now faster, and Java 7 is supported.</p> 
<p><strong>In-Genius:<br /> </strong>In-Genius in-memory intelligence platform, whose general availability is planned for the third quarter of 2013,&nbsp;combines in-memory data management, with event stream processing and messaging to deliver real-time insights. It&nbsp;can process event transactions, identify patterns and create actions based on predicted behavior.&nbsp;The product is certified to operate with Oracle, SAP Hana and Hadoop environments.</p> 
<p>The industry use cases where the combination of BigMemory4 and In-Genius add value to real time analysis efforts, include:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Financial Services: In-Genius helps the organizations in realizing cost savings by stopping fraudulent transactions in financial services applications,&nbsp;using complex pattern detection before transaction authorizations occur rather than after.</li> 
 <li>Logistics Companies: It helps with real-time supply management routings based on package location and also on historical data, traffic sensors, weather, calendar events and other patterns emerging from data.</li> 
 <li>Retail Stores: Real time insights help with instant and personalized recommendations on the web and at the point of sale across all stores, enhancing revenues and personalizing the consumer's shopping experience for enhanced brand loyalty.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>InfoQ spoke with Andy Raskin, Senior Director of Product Marketing at Terracotta, about the latest version of BigMemory platform and the new product In-Genius.</p> 
<p><strong>InfoQ: What is the difference between the traditional caching solution and in-memory data grid?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Andy:</strong> To understand the differences, you have to first understand the profound shift that's taking place in where data lives. Traditional caching solutions came about at a time when data was mostly stored on disks. It was too expensive to keep large amounts of data in memory, but you could get a performance gain if you kept some in memory. Thus, caching. Still, all a cache really had to do was serve up data quickly and be somewhat smart about the data it held.</p> 
<p>Today, thanks to plummeting RAM prices, it is practical to keep most -- or all -- of your data in memory. There's a temptation to think of that as just a really big cache, but there's really something fundamentally different going on. In particular, all of the high availability, fault-tolerance, and data management and monitoring that you used to get from disk-bound databases -- now you want that from your in-memory store.</p> 
<p>So BigMemory 4.0 is about giving enterprise app developers not only really fast, predictable access to data, but also delivering all of that other functionality that enterprises are used to.</p> 
<p><strong>InfoQ: What is the support for monitoring in the new architecture where these two new products, BigMemory 4 and In-Genius, work together to process BigData?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Andy:</strong> BigMemory 4.0 introduces the Terracotta Management Console (TMC) for sophisticated monitoring and management of distributed in-memory data sets.&nbsp; It's a Web-based dashboard that gives administrators and developers a wealth of real-time insights into how their in-memory data sets are performing, and tools for configuring behavior. Because In-Genius is powered by BigMemory, the TMC is available in both platforms.</p> 
<p><strong>InfoQ: What is the future road map for BigMemory product?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Without giving much away… With BigMemory 4.0, you're seeing BigMemory with better performance, better scalability, better features for high availability, and better integrations with other enterprise data sources (Hadoop, etc.).&nbsp; You can expect future versions of BigMemory to deliver more in each of those areas while making it even easier for enterprises to gain the benefits of shifting their data to an in-memory platform.</p> 
<p><strong>InfoQ: What is the future road map for In-Genius product?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Andy:</strong> We're particularly excited about the roadmap for In-Genius, especially since the reaction to our launch announcement has been so positive. We're hearing from so many enterprises in so many different verticals — financial services, retail, government, media, logistics, just to name a few — about how they plan to use it to link Big Data intelligence to instant, profitable action. We'll be making more announcements about In-Genius later this year.</p>
