<p>Conference chair Mitch Lacey said</p>
<blockquote>
 The Agile Alliance annual conference is a phenomenal opportunity to share your knowledge and experience, Last year we were joined by nearly 1,800 Agilists from 38 countries who gathered to hear from recognized experts, authors and innovators. Competition for the 200 or so speaking slots continues to grow. I encourage Agilists with a story to tell to submit early.
</blockquote>
<p>Submissions for the conference are selected by a peer review process and those who submit proposals early will receive reviews and will have the opportunity to change their proposals and respond to those reviews.</p>
<p>Potential presenters are encouraged to carefully review the 17 available conference <a href="http://agile2014.agilealliance.org/program/subpage/">tracks</a> and submit proposals under the track that most nearly represents their proposed topic(s). The tracks cover all aspects of Agile development, from tips to get started with small teams to advanced, enterprise strategies based on years of experiences.</p>
