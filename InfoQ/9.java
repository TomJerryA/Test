Moreover, the parameter names correspond to the property names and insert and update stored procedures should include a parameter for every property except for those marked as identity or computed and the delete stored procedure should have a parameter for the key value of the entity.</p> 
<p>Let us take a look at the following code snippet<br /> <br /> <code> public class Blog <br /> { <br /> &nbsp; public int BlogId { get; set; } <br /> &nbsp; public string Name { get; set; } <br /> &nbsp; public string Url { get; set; } <br /> } </code></p> 
<p>The insert stored procedure corresponding to the above code should look like as shown below<br /> <br /> <code> CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[Blog_Insert] <br /> &nbsp; @Name varchar(max), <br /> &nbsp; @Url varchar(max) <br /> AS <br /> &nbsp; INSERT INTO [dbo].[Blogs] ([Name], [Url])<br /> &nbsp; VALUES (@Name, @Url)<br /> <br /> &nbsp; SELECT SCOPE_IDENTITY() AS BlogId </code></p> 
<p>The update and delete procedures will be ab shown below<br /> <br /> <code> CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[Blog_Update] <br /> &nbsp; @BlogId int, <br /> &nbsp; @Name varchar(max), <br /> &nbsp; @Url varchar(max) <br /> AS <br /> &nbsp; UPDATE [dbo].[Blogs]&nbsp;&nbsp; SET [Name] = @Name, [Url] = @Url&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /> &nbsp; WHERE BlogId = @BlogId; </code><br /> <br /> <br /> <code> CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[Blog_Delete] <br /> &nbsp; @BlogId int <br /> AS <br /> &nbsp; DELETE FROM [dbo].[Blogs]<br /> &nbsp; WHERE BlogId = @BlogId </code></p> 
<p>The official <a href="http://entityframework.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Code%20First%20Insert%2fUpdate%2fDelete%20Stored%20Procedure%20Mapping">documentation</a> examines all the possible scenarios in detail. <br /> <br /> Entity Framework 6 Alpha 3 includes <a href="http://entityframework.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Connection%20Resiliency%20Spec">connection resiliency</a> that enables automatic recovery from transient connection failures. It is implemented using IExecutionStrategy interface which in turn make use of IRetriableExceptionDetector and IRetryDelayStrategy interfaces.</p> 
<p>According to official sources, Entity Framework will ship with four execution strategies such as NonRetryingExecutionStrategy, DefaultSqlExecutionStrategy, ExecutionStrategy and SqlAzureExecutionStrategy.<br /> <br /> Entity Framework 6 Alpha 3 provides an ability to pull request from <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/site/users/view/iceclow">iceclow</a> that allows you to create custom migrations operations and process them in a custom migrations SQL generator. <a href="http://romiller.com/2013/02/27/ef6-writing-your-own-code-first-migration-operations/">Rowan Miller</a>, Program Manager, ADO.NET Entity Framework, Microsoft has examined the implementation of iceclow with relevant code samples. <br /> <br /> The Alpha 3 also enables you to pull request from <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/site/users/view/UnaiZorrilla">UnaiZorrilla</a> which provides a pluggable pluralization and singularization service including the ability to manage your own transactions with the help of DbContext.Database.UseTransaction and DbContext.Database.BeginTransaction APIs.</p>
