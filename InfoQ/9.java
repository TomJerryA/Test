They both claim that you need to be genuine in the way you interact with your communities.&nbsp;<a href="https://puppetlabs.com/">PuppetLabs</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.opscode.com">Opscode</a>&nbsp;both succeeded in building thriving Open Source communities alongside growing businesses.</p> 
<p class="p1"><a href="http://www.linux.com/news/featured-blogs/196-zonker/707984-puppet-labs-ceo-how-to-grow-an-authentic-open-source-community">“A lot of companies think you can force the creation of a community,” but you can’t, says Kanies</a> during his <a href="http://na.apachecon.com/schedule/presentation/222/">keynote at ApacheConf</a>. He adds that you need to be honest in answering questions, but transparency is not the same as openness. He isn't <a href="http://www.linux.com/news/featured-blogs/196-zonker/707984-puppet-labs-ceo-how-to-grow-an-authentic-open-source-community">going to answer questions about funding or other topics that aren’t something he can disclose to the entire community.</a> For Kanies it's essential to engage the community instead of simply announcing changes. The example he mentioned was the license switch from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License">GPL</a> to <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache</a>. The process took months but eventually only two out of 3,000 community members complained.</p> 
<p class="p1">Jacob told InfoQ that the foundation of a community is respect. Only if you take the community seriously do you have a chance to succeed. Being transparent in how you operate is essential. One example he mentioned was their <a href="http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/How+to+Contribute">Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a>. People don't like the hassle of filling it out but it makes it absolutely transparent that every contributor has the exact same rights as Opscode.</p> 
<p class="p1">Jacob emphasized that every company has a choice about which role it plays in the Open Source community around their products. A company can either consider their software as a gift to the community while keeping the rights to exploit contributions for themselves or a company can decide that every contributor should be equal. Opscode, he says, took the latter approach.</p>
