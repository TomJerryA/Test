<p>Back in November, the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp">White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP)</a> announced a five-year, <a href="http://www.moore.org/newsroom/press-releases/2013/11/12/%20bold_new_partnership_launches_to_harness_potential_of_data_scientists_and_big_data"> $37.8 million project </a> to help popularize data science and big data for tomorrow’s scientists, and create a framework for collaboration between leading universities in this field, namely <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/">New York University</a>, <a href="http://www.washington.edu/">University of Washington</a>, and <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/">University of California, Berkeley</a>. Funding for this project comes from the Moore Foundation and the Sloan Foundation. This partnership is trying to “change the culture of universities to create a data science culture”, says Joshua Greenberg, director of the Sloan Foundation’s Digital Information Technology program, in a statement that highlights the main ambition behind this project.</p>
<p>The universities involved in this initiative had already launched their own Data Science programs earlier in 2013: Berkeley with its<a href="http://datascience.berkeley.edu/">online Master’s degree in Data Science</a> announced in July, NYU unveiled a new<a href="http://cds.nyu.edu/academics/ms-in-data-science/">Master’s degree in Data Science</a> as part of its<a href="http://cds.nyu.edu/">Center for Data Science</a> in March which began in September. With popular Big Data projects such as <a href="http://spark.incubator.apache.org/">Spark</a> developed by research teams in this group, there are many expectations for the future graduates of these degrees in an industry starving for this kind of talent.</p>
<p>One of the highlights of 2013 has been the popularization of the MOOCs – online courses involving a large student population from different backgrounds - and there were many opportunities for data scientists to learn. Aspiring data scientists could get an introduction to the field on MOOC platform&nbsp;<a href="http://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a> with <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/datasci">a course</a> from university of Washington’s <a href="http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~billhowe/">director of research Bill Howe</a>. The topics covered included everything a data scientist needs to know from relational databases, NoSQL, machine learning, MapReduce and Hadoop to more abstract fields like data visualization. With a rate of completion of more than 15% - when the typical MOOC has a completion rate of less than 10% - and an overwhelmingly positive response in <a href="https://class.coursera.org/datasci-001/forum">the course forums</a>, this course aligns well with the high-demand for data scientists today, and is due for a repeat this year.</p>
<p>Other online universities have also jumped on the bandwagon regarding data science. For example, <a href="http://www.udacity.com/">Udacity</a> has partnered with Big Data startup <a href="http://www.cloudera.com/">Cloudera</a> in November to offer an <a href="http://blog.udacity.com/2013/11/sebastian-thrun-launching-our-data.html">online data science training</a> centered around Big Data. The first course in this track is an introduction to Hadoop and MapReduce, taught by Cloudera instructors and centered on hands-on knowledge about writing Hadoop MapReduce jobs and using HDFS. Cloudera already has a lot of credibility built around Hadoop, with its popular Hadoop distributions and the open-source project <a href="https://github.com/cloudera/impala">Impala</a>, so there is a lot to expect from this training. Interested individuals can already sign up for the free courseware, even if the full course is scheduled to start in January 2014.</p>
<p>With these new opportunities, there has been a lot of buzz around the field of data science. Take <a href="http://www.hilarymason.com/about/">Hilary Mason</a>, a famous data scientist in NYC who also co-founded <a href="http://hackny.org/">HackNY</a>, who twitted in November that “Data science is a growing area”. At Strata 2013 in NYC there was <a href="http://strataconf.com/stratany2013/public/schedule/detail/30657">a session</a> with Yann LeCun, director of the data science program at NYU, going in depth on the recent data science opportunities and how they are making data science one of the <a href="http://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century/">sexiest jobs of the 21st century</a>.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br></body></html>
