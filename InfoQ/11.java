 <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now the entire project is available on Microsoft’s <a href="http://roslyn.codeplex.com/">CodePlex</a>, freely available for use by all developers whether they are on Windows or otherwise.&nbsp; With Git installed, you can obtain the project directly via a <a href="https://git01.codeplex.com/roslyn">clone</a> operation.&nbsp; 
 <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you only want to try out Roslyn, the preview is available on <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=394641">Connect</a>.&nbsp; If you want to truly dig into the code and compile it on your own environment for testing and experimentation, you will need VS2013 Professional or higher, the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40758">Visual Studio 2013 SDK</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42307">VS2013 Update 2 RC</a>, and the .NET Compiler Platform <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=394641">(Roslyn) End User Preview</a>.&nbsp; 
 <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The roadmap listed on Roslyn’s project page lists <a href="http://roslyn.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Roadmap&amp;referringTitle=Home">numerous items</a> under development most of which can be classified as a feature addition or quality improvement.&nbsp; A <a href="https://roslyn.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Language%20Feature%20Status&amp;referringTitle=Documentation">status page</a> exists to list the current state of new features being written for C# and VB.
 <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Today’s release of key technology at the foundation of .NET marks an important shift in Microsoft’s thinking.&nbsp; While the runtime (CLR) is not open source, the compiler’s visibility should lead to improved benefits for all regardless of their platform.&nbsp; (The Mono project’s CLR allows non-Microsoft platforms to run the code produced by Roslyn.)
