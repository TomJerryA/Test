Opscode calls it &quot;#learnchef&quot;, which is also the name of the <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channel=learnchef">IRC channel new users can join on freenode</a> to ask questions and get further information.</p>

 Seth Vargo, #learnchef Lead @ Opscode, expresses Opscode's motivation behind creating this new learning avenue as follows:
</div> 
<blockquote>
 We created 
 <a href="https://learnchef.opscode.com/">#learnchef</a> to be a fun, inviting, and engaging entry point for Chef. It was established with a single goal in mind: What's the fastest way for a new user to go from zero to converge? We are filling a gap that has existed in Chef for a long time. Everything from the content, design, and the campaign was created with the end user in mind. From the How-To Screencasts to the Common Use Cases, we hope new Cheffers find the #learnchef campaign intuitive and exciting from the start.
 <br />

 The #learnchef quickstart provides three sections: &quot;Workstation Setup&quot;, &quot;Using Chef Repo&quot;, &quot;Converge a Node&quot;. The operating system being worked on determines the setup, information is provided for Mac, Linux, and Windows. Additionally, Opscode provides a starting 
 <a href="https://github.com/opscode/chef-repo">chef repo through GitHub</a> to help users begin downloading, editing, and creating cookbooks. The content explains how to use the installed applications to converge a VirtualBox virtual machine node using a Chef repo combined with community cookbooks and user created cookbooks.&nbsp;

 Short screencasts provide supporting content for the quickstart guide. Material covered includes: Chef repo creation, installing applications, managing &quot;.pem&quot; files, and registering with Hosted Chef. A troubleshooting section provides guidance on dealing with common errors and problems including: 401 unauthorized error, 403 forbidden error, and other workflow problems.&nbsp;
