The recently released <a href="http://www.axonframework.org/news/axon-2-0-released/">version 2.0</a> also lets event objects be based on POJOs and annotations to define messages, payload and metadata. Other features in the new version include:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>A high performance command bus which, by processing commands in parallel using a lockless algorithm, is capable of handling four times more commands per time unit.</li> 
 <li>Logic to ensure serialization of an event is only made once and deserialization made only when the event is actually used.</li> 
 <li>Significantly faster in replaying of large number of events.</li> 
 <li>A distributed command bus allowing for horizontal scaling over several machines with the load adjusted for each machine.</li> 
 <li>Support for upcasting and <a href="http://blog.trifork.com/2012/04/17/refactoring-in-an-event-sourced-world-upcasting-in-axon-2/">demultiplexing</a> of events, i.e. transforming old events into multiple new events after a new event structure is implemented.</li> 
 <li><a href="http://www.amqp.org/">AMQP</a> can be used to distribute events.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>The team also published a <a href="http://www.axonframework.org/axon-2-quickstart-guide/">QuickStart Guide</a> with the steps needed to build a simple system based on Axon and updated the <a href="http://www.axonframework.org/docs/2.0/single.html">Reference Guide</a> to reflect the changes in the framework.</p> 
<p>Axon Framework provides the building blocks for systems based on the CQRS and <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html">Event Sourcing</a> architectural patterns, two patterns that are receiving an increasing interest. The Domain-Driven Design (DDD) community website, maintained by among others Eric Evans, author of the <a href="http://domaindrivendesign.org/books/evans_2003">DDD reference book</a>, specifically <a href="http://domaindrivendesign.org/">notes</a> the importance:</p> 
<p>“CQRS &amp; Event Sourcing are two closely related architectural approaches to DDD and they are the hottest topics in DDD of the last couple of years.”</p> 
<p>Axon Framework, founded by <a href="http://blog.trifork.com/author/allard/">Allard Buijze</a>, is an open source product, licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0, with commercial support as an option.</p> 
<p>A <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/axonframework">forum</a> for Axon users is available with about 200 members and so far around 300 topics. A discussion about <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9646884/real-life-experience-with-the-axon-framework">real world experiences</a> reveals both positive and negative feedback on the framework.<br /> &nbsp;</p>
