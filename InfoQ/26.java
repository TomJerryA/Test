<p>Cloudant has been an active contributor to the Apache <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a> project. Cloudant has been offering an online <a href="https://cloudant.com/nosql/">Database as a Service</a> (DBaaS) based on CouchDB. CouchDB is an <a href="http://guide.couchdb.org/draft/consistency.html">eventually consistent</a>, <a href="http://couchdb.readthedocs.org/en/latest/json-structure.html">JSON</a> based <a href="https://cloudant.com/press-releases/cloudant-contributes-database-scalability-and-fault-tolerance-framework-to-apache-couchdb/">scalable</a> NoSQL database. CouchDB offers <a href="http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/intro/tour.html?highlight=mapreduce#running-a-query-using-mapreduce">MapReduce</a> functionality through Javascript and an <a href="http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/intro/api.html">HTTP API</a> for data access. The DBaaS offering and contribution to CouchDB are not going to be affected by the acquisition. A month ago, Cloudant also started expanding in the Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS) space by offering a synchronization <a href="https://cloudant.com/press-releases/new-cloudant-sync-software-libraries-help-developers-manage-and-replicate-mobile-app-data-with-cloud-databases/">service</a> for Android and iOS offline based applications.</p>
<p>Adding CouchDB to IBM’s arsenal of technologies together with <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324563004578525001921101148">SoftLayer</a> acquisition and <a href="http://www.mongodb.com/press/ibm-and-10gen-collaborate-bring-mobile-enterprise">MongoDB</a> partnership creates an ecosystem of technologies bringing IBM in direct comparison with <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a>. IBM is collaborating with MongoDB on a new standard for interchangeable <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/06/04/ibm-throws-its-weight-behind-mongodb-for-mobile-apps/">access</a> of DB2 and MongoDB back end from mobile apps. With Cloudant and SoftLayer, IBM is able to offer a CouchDB DBaaS offering comparable to Amazon’s <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/">DynamoDB</a> or Rackspace’s <a href="http://www.objectrocket.com/">ObjectRocket</a>. <br /> A comparison of these three technologies by <a href="https://cloudant.com/product/comparison-of-dbaas/">Cloudant</a> shows the strong points of Cloudant’s offering. Lucene powered <a href="https://cloudant.com/for-developers/search/">full text search</a> is the major selling point. Advanced Geo-spatial <a href="https://cloudant.com/product/cloudant-features/geospatial/">capabilities</a> based on R-trees is also supported. Durability, multi-master <a href="https://cloudant.com/product/cloudant-features/replication/">replication</a> and <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cloudant-contributes-database-scalability-and-fault-tolerance-framework-to-apache-couchdb-216420361.html">fault tolerance</a> are also listed as advantages over competing platforms.</p>
<p>Commercial support for CouchDB has not been uninterrupted throughout the past years with CouchOne withdrawing support after the <a href="http://www.couchbase.com/press-releases/membase-couchone-merge">merge</a> with MemBase into <a href="http://www.couchbase.com/">CouchBase</a>. Cloudant stepped in <a href="http://www.cmswire.com/cms/information-management/cloudant-breathes-life-into-couchdb-merges-bigcouch-into-apache-project-021806.php">contributing</a> its own fork of CouchDB, BigCouch into the open source codebase and picking up on commercial support. With backing from IBM, enterprise architects can be assured that commercial support will be available and development will continue as planned.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br></body></html>
