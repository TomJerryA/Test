In contrast to the previously released Windows 8, the Embedded version is designed for use in applications such as dedicated point-of-sale devices, healthcare, and manufacturing systems. </span></p> 
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">The WE8 platform is composed of three different releases: Standard, Pro, and Industry Release Preview. They serve different markets, with Microsoft explaining it this way:</p> 
<blockquote> 
 <ul> 
  <li> <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Standard</strong> - “... a fully functional version of Microsoft’s desktop operating system intended for use in an embedded solution consisting of purpose-built hardware and application software.”</p> </li> 
  <li> <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Pro</strong> - “... a componentized version of Windows 8 with additional technologies that extend the power of Windows to specialized devices.”</p> </li> 
  <li> <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Industry Release Preview</strong> – Is designed for “... building differentiated devices that are part of an Intelligent System” which Microsoft indicates would be found in the retail, financial, and hospitality sectors.</p> </li> 
 </ul> 
</blockquote> 
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Windows Embedded offers Lockdown, features designed to give OEMs and device manufacturers greater control over Windows' operation. These include Keyboard Filter, Dialog Filter, Application Launcher, and Embedded Lockdown Manager.</p> 
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Another benefit of using Windows Embedded over the typical Windows desktop client is the increased product support life-cycle. The embedded series have a 10-year support period and an overall product availability of 15 years. &nbsp;Note that <a class="western" href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsembedded/en-us/evaluate/choose-a-windows-embedded-operating-system.aspx?DeviceTypeID=8">unlike Windows Embedded Compact 7</a>, the WE8 platform requires the use of a third-party plug-in to provide real-time OS support.</p>
