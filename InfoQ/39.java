Compared to the prior updates, this seems to be a more subdued release which may be due to its primary focus on bug fixes as Brian Harry predicted at the time of Update 2's release.</p> 
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Users of Team Foundation Server will receive the bulk of updates. Feature-wise, administrators will appreciate that build settings can be preserved when upgrading a TFS2012 instance. Several frustrating bugs are corrected that address everything from TFS interaction with SQL Server to observing the correct localization settings in the web installer.</p> 
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Other improvements:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>C++ developers will benefit from a performance fix when <a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/751327">debugging mixed mode</a> applications.</li> 
 <li>An unidentified error causing web projects to fail has been fixed.</li> 
 <li>The IDE will once again support bringing the user to the line of a build error/warning for BizTalk projects.</li> 
</ul> 
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Interestingly, in what is termed a “limitation in this preview”, the installation of CTP3 requires an Internet connection in any scenario, even with an ISO-based installation. Full release notes are located in this <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2835600">knowledge base article</a>. &nbsp;Users and administrators of TFS2012 are encouraged to review this article as there are a number of fixes that they may find beneficial.</p>
