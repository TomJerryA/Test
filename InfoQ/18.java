It no longer rewrites the X-CouchDB-Requested-Path during recursive calls to the rewriter and also adds <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/eventsource/">Server-Sent Events</a> protocol to db changes API. Moreover, the latest release also enables you to make password hashing synchronous when using the /_config/admins API and includes user name in show/list ETags.</p> 
<p>CouchDB 1.3.0 provides solution for the unnecessary conflict when you create and delete a document in the same batch and the replicator included with the database will make use of a new server-wide UUID in checkpoint IDs to improve the chances of an efficient resume. It also moved the JS <a href="http://lenaherrmann.net/2010/04/28/writing-a-testsuite-for-the-couchdb-api">test suite</a> to the CLI with improved trackbacks and test reliability.</p> 
<p>The recent release has disabled the link to the <a href="http://answers.oreilly.com/topic/1395-introduction-to-couchdbs-futon-administration-interface/">Futon</a> test suite and also added view request duration to Futon in addition to disabling those buttons for which user doesn't have permissions. Moreover, <a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/autotools-announce/2008-09/msg00002.html">Autoconf v2.63</a> is required if you build from Git checkout directly. According to official sources, Futon test suite causes problems when run from a web browser and hence has been made available via the CLI.</p> 
<p>In CouchDB 1.3.0, passwords are hashed using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2">PBKDF2</a> (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) algorithm with a configurable work factor and provides support for utc_id algorithm. Moreover, the database name is encoded during rewriting with improved C/C++ compiler detection. It also resets rewrite counter on new request and also fixes an issue where stopped status returns before process exits in couchdb script.</p> 
<p>CouchDB 1.3.0 includes pre-built packages for Windows and OS X in addition to a manual that is hosted directly out of Futon. Apache also provides manual in PDF format along with the installation package.</p>
