Matching the content of a webpage with relevant ads is the goal of every advertiser as it improves click through rates and drives down cost per click. AlchemyAPI delivers an API that can drill down to 1,000 categories and down to five levels deep. The API also offers the ability to create new <a href="http://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwgeeks/article/AlchemyAPI-Launches-First-Of-Its-Kind-Deep-Learning-Based-Taxonomy-and-Sentiment-APIs-Transforming-Content-Into-Valuable-Digital-Ad-Inventory-20140326#.Uzm0j62Sygh">categories</a> from any arbitrary phrase. This can be useful for niche content that can’t otherwise be targeted by ads.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/google-deepmind-artificial-intelligence/">Deep learning</a> is a bottom-up approach using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning">unsupervised learning</a> to train a system and then using feedback from other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning">supervised learning</a> systems to refine the results. Coupled with Big Data and several layers, Deep Neural Networks can deliver <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/JrgenSandig/neural-networks-and-deep-learning/4">better accuracy</a> across a broad range of applications. <br /> Throughout the past months there has been high activity in the deep learning space with a series of product launches and acquisitions. </p>
<p>IBM is utilizing Watson, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watson_%28computer%29">Jeopardy</a> winner for <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/43444.wss">research</a> on <a href="http://www.nygenome.org/events/revolutionizing-genomics-personalized-medicine-ibm-watson/">personalized medicine</a>. Watson uses <a href="http://www.aaai.org/Magazine/Watson/watson.php">DeepQA</a> to analyze, process and answer questions with confidence.<br /> Yahoo has acquired <a href="http://lookflow.com/">LookFlow</a> and <a href="http://www.iqengines.com/">IQ Engines</a>, both in the image recognition space. LookFlow is using deep learning for <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/10/23/yahoo-buys-image-recognition-startup-lookflow/">image recognition</a> and will join the Flickr team and apply their knowledge in deep learning projects for Yahoo. <br /> Facebook <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/12/09/facebook-hires-nyu-deep-learning-expert-to-run-its-new-ai-lab/">hired</a> NYU deep learning expert <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/">Yann LeCun</a> to run its AI lab. Yann LeCun is leading efforts to make Facebook <a href="http://www.kdnuggets.com/2014/02/exclusive-yann-lecun-deep-learning-facebook-ai-lab.html">better understand</a> people and pick the correct subset of information to show to them.<br /> Microsoft recently demoed a speech-to-speech English to Mandarin <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/next/archive/2012/11/08/microsoft-research-shows-a-promising-new-breakthrough-in-speech-translation-technology.aspx#.UzpZZK2Sygh">translation</a> engine, claiming to have reduced error rates by 30% the most in speech recognition since hidden Markov modelling was introduced in 1979.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Google acquired DeepMind in January, a startup that is working towards building an AI system that <a href="http://normaldeviate.wordpress.com/2012/10/30/the-future-of-machine-learning-and-the-end-of-the-world/">thinks</a>, according to Carnegie Mellon professor <a href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/">Larry Waserman</a>. DeepMind boasts a lineup of great <a href="http://blog.mikiobraun.de/2014/01/what-deepmind-google.html">researchers</a> in the AI field, on par with Google’s own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Norvig">researchers</a>. Google is investing heavily in deep learning and not without a reason as search, pattern recognition for security puproses, social and commerce <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/google-deepmind-artificial-intelligence/#!CidET">can all benefit</a> from better AI systems.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br></body></html>
