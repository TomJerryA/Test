It can be important for organizations to&nbsp;have insight&nbsp;in the relation between&nbsp;a maturity level&nbsp;and their business goals, and to know which business benefits they can expect from the improvements. Michelle Krupa, Project Portfolio Director at SITA,&nbsp;talked about the challenge of moving from a certification-led to benefits-led&nbsp;improvement program at the <a href="http://www.sepg.unicom.co.uk/">SEPG Europe 2013</a>&nbsp;conference.</p>
<p>InfoQ did an interview with Michelle in which she explains&nbsp;how they changed their improvement program from being CMMI Maturity Level based&nbsp;to a benefits led approach.</p>
<p><strong>InfoQ: Thanks Michelle for doing this interview. For those not knowing SITA, can you describe what kind of business they are in?</strong></p>
<blockquote> 
 <p><strong>Michelle: </strong>SITA delivers and manage business solutions for air transport, global distribution systems and government customers over the world’s most extensive network.We collaborate with industry bodies to provide a portfolio of communication and IT services — specifically for the air transport industry (ATI). Working with the ATI, we innovate and develop information technology applications and communication services.</p> 
</blockquote>
<p><strong>InfoQ: The goal of the improvement program was to get CMMI Maturity Level 3. Why was this goal chosen?</strong></p>
<blockquote> 
 <p><strong>Michelle: </strong>It was felt that by achieving that level the Software Development and Quality organizations would have a level of repeatability in their quality, delivery and on target achievements</p> 
</blockquote>
<p><strong>InfoQ: The improvement program was started based upon a business case. But then there was a budget cut. How did the program handle this?</strong></p>
<blockquote> 
 <p><strong>Michelle: </strong>The program took it in stride.&nbsp; We looked to see what we could do with what we had to work with. Instead of using external process consultants, we looked to leverage our internal resources.&nbsp; We had an internal Lead Appraiser that was also a certified SEI trainer, so there was a level of cost savings at the training level as well.</p> 
 <p>We realized that our internal knowledge and experience would only take us so far.&nbsp; We lost our Internal Lead Appraiser and looked to fill that gap with a consulting firm that not only had the experience, but was a match for our organizational culture.</p> 
</blockquote>
<p><strong>InfoQ: You talked about &quot;avoiding the hard stuff&quot;. Can you elaborate on that? </strong></p>
<blockquote> 
 <p><strong>Michelle: </strong>Of course we unknowingly avoided the hard stuff.&nbsp; It was never an intentional thing.&nbsp; Our processes met the ML2 goals and projects were using the processes, however, measurement was not very effective.&nbsp; We measured what we could measure rather than measures that made sense.&nbsp; When we dug deeper into the organization, we found that, though the project looked like they were following the processes, it hadn’t really taken a deep root throughout the team and the Project Managers were more Process Managers.</p> 
</blockquote>
<p><strong>InfoQ: What was done to change the focus of the improvement program, while still keeping the original goal of maturity level 3? </strong></p>
<blockquote> 
 <p><strong>Michelle: </strong>We went back to the business case.&nbsp; We looked at what the program was meant to deliver and why.&nbsp; While the goal was ultimately to achieve ML3, it was also meant to deliver a set of benefits.</p> 
 <p>We looked at the SITA Strategic vision, the SITA Strategic goals, and aligned each program benefit to a Strategic Goal.&nbsp; I went to the program sponsor, my Senior Vice President and worked with him to get the benefits sponsor with our internal customers, which all report into him.&nbsp; We built a set of Key Benefit Indicators and are now defining the supporting KPIs.&nbsp; Each of our Solution Line Vice Presidents has been involved at the detail level of defining and agreeing the KBIs and KPIs.</p> 
</blockquote>
<p><strong>InfoQ: You mentioned that the target of the program was redefined. What was the new target, and how did this help? </strong></p>
<blockquote> 
 <p><strong>Michelle: </strong>The focus has now turned to delivering those benefits and seeing a return on investment.&nbsp; ML3 is still a goal, but seeing the benefits delivered is the immediate focus.&nbsp; This helps us focus on the right things.&nbsp; Using business terms to relate what may be impacting the program.&nbsp; It ties the Solution Line VPs into seeing value for money they are investing in the program.&nbsp; It elevates the visibility and strategic importance of the program as a whole.</p> 
</blockquote>
<p><strong>InfoQ: Which learnings from this improvement program do you want to share with the InfoQ readers? </strong></p>
<blockquote> 
 <p><strong>Michelle:</strong> Our learnings are:</p> 
 <p>Don’t let a certification drive your improvement program</p> 
 <p>Understand what the business needs from your program and deliver it</p> 
 <p>Don’t let measurement wait, you will loose your way</p> 
 <p>Transparency and accountability are your friend even if they hurt sometimes</p> 
 <p>Sponsorship is critical, you need to be able to use political power</p> 
 <p>Address process deployment, you get no benefits if it is not used</p> 
 <p>Having processes is not the same as benefits delivered</p>
