Curoverse is a private cloud platform for the biomedical industry. Curoverse is backing <a href="https://arvados.org/"><span class="s1">Arvados</span></a>, the open source bioinformatics platform. Tute genomics is offering a cloud based genome analysis solution, helping researchers interpret sequenced data from human exome and even genome.</p>
<p class="p2">Gene sequencing costs have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/$1,000_genome"><span class="s1">slashed</span></a> in the past years, making it easier to market the service to a larger audience. In the meanwhile, storage and computing power have increased following <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law"><span class="s1">Moore’s law</span></a>, making it easier to analyze and store the full genome of a human being.</p>
<p class="p2">But still, a fully sequenced human genome is in the range of 100-1,000 GB of data. A million customers’ data can add up to an exabyte or around 1,000,000 TB of data. Researchers from UC Berkeley have proposed a feasible way to manage this <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2012/EECS-2012-211.pdf"><span class="s1">database</span></a> using a three tiered storage approach of 100 PB, one petabyte and one terabyte out of which only the last one would be RDBMS based. The holy grail for this effort is <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/rgrossman/bionimbus-towards-one-million-genomes-xldb-2012-lecture/8"><span class="s1">personalized medicine</span></a>. Humans share <a href="http://www.genome.gov/17516714"><span class="s1">99.9% of DNA</span></a> and the hypothesis is that analyzing the full genome sequence for many patients will discover what is hiding in this 0.1% that can be used to predict and cure many diseases including cancer.</p>
<p class="p2">On the computing power side, specialized hardware is being used to <a href="http://gigaom.com/2012/04/30/straight-outta-stanford-bina-wants-to-remake-genome-analysis/"><span class="s1">analyze genome data faster</span></a>. The cost of sequencing human genome has dropped <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ4a0iDTpi8#t=6"><span class="s1">100,000 time fold</span></a> in the past 10 years and the time to analyze it has fallen from <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/gcoates/next-generation-genomcs-petascale-data-in-the-life-sciences/6"><span class="s1">13 years to less than three days</span></a>.</p>
<p class="p2">In the research world, there are already sequencing centers analyzing and storing <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/gcoates/life-sciencesoverview/8"><span class="s1">data</span></a>, each from a small number of patients. The real challenge is combining these datasets across different archives and <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/gcoates/life-sciencesoverview/11"><span class="s1">cross referencing</span></a> them with patient records, treatments and outcomes.</p>
<p class="p2">Throughout the past years, private companies have stepped in and started offering genome analysis for the masses. Organizations like <a href="http://www.illumina.com/"><span class="s1">Illumina</span></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sbgenomics.com/">Seven Bridges Genomics</a>, <a href="http://www.completegenomics.com/"><span class="s1">Complete Genomics</span></a> and others are offering researchers and private parties the opportunity to map the full genome sequence for a four figure quote. Illumina recently announced <a href="http://investor.illumina.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=121127&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1890696"><span class="s1">HiSeq X Ten</span></a>, promising the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/18/science/18dna.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0"><span class="s1">long-awaited</span></a> &nbsp;$1,000 genome sequencing.</p>
<p class="p2">Illumina has launched a cloud computing and storage platform called <a href="https://basespace.illumina.com/home/index"><span class="s1">BaseSpace</span></a>, allowing scientists to sequence, analyze and collaborate on data that are being stored in <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/illumina/"><span class="s1">Amazon Web Services</span></a>. Bioinformatics applications can also be developed using their <a href="https://developer.basespace.illumina.com/"><span class="s1">API and SDKs</span></a>.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><a href="https://www.sbgenomics.com/">Seven Bridges Genomics</a></span>, on the other hand, is using a combination of cloud and NoSQL database technologies like EC2, S3 and <a href="http://www.mongodb.com/press/seven-bridges-genomics-relies-mongodb-next-generation-sequencing-analysis"><span class="s1">MongoDB</span></a> for human genome sequencing and <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/seven-bridges-genomics/"><span class="s1">analysis</span></a>. Glacier is also used to bring down data storage costs. Seven Bridges PaaS provides a GUI to setup data pipelines which can be based off predefined models or modified to fit the task at hand.</p>
<p class="p2">For the aspiring bioinformatics developers, <a href="http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/crossbow/index.shtml"><span class="s1">Crossbow</span></a> is one of the tools that can be used for whole genome resequencing <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/fccoelho/fabricio-cloud-20131025/16"><span class="s1">analysis</span></a>. By combining several libraries it can analyze a human genome in under three hours for less than $100 in AWS. Intel offers a step-by-step <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/reports/genome-resequencing-with-crossbow-report.pdf"><span class="s1">guide</span></a> and the source code can be found in <a href="https://github.com/BenLangmead/crossbow"><span class="s1">GitHub</span></a>.</p>
<p class="p1">The $15 <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/25/with-6-5m-in-tow-bina-technologies-wants-to-bring-big-data-insight-to-genomic-sequencing/"><span class="s1">billion</span></a> genomic research industry is just starting to heat up and advances in technology will extend the notion of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_Self"><span class="s1">quantified self</span></a> farther than what we have seen up until today.</p>
