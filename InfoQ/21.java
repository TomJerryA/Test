The acquisition includes exclusive rights to all related intellectual property.</p> 
<p>Javeleon was founded in 2012 to commercialize technology built upon research at the Maersk McKinney Moeller Institute at the University of Southern Denmark.</p> 
<p>Javeleon co-founders Dr. Allan Gregersen and Michael Rasmussen will join forces with ZeroTurnaroundâ€™s product and engineering teams in Estonia.</p> 
<p>InfoQ asked Alex Laats, ZeroTurnaround President &amp; COO about the acquisition.</p> 
<p><b>Will you be acquiring any Javeleon staff besides the founders?</b></p> 
<blockquote>
 Nope. Javeleon just launched in 2012 and Allan and Michael were the entire team.
</blockquote> 
<p><b> </b></p> 
<p><b>Will the acquisition instantly drive more market share for JRebel?</b><b> </b></p> 
<blockquote>
  Javeleon targeted the same market as JRebel. Current market share for Javeleon is negligible, so this is really about strengthening ZeroTurnaround's grip as the dominant player in the market for Java developers.
</blockquote> 
<p><b>What will Javeleon's technology add to the JRebel feature set?</b></p> 
<blockquote>
 The most obvious difference is the ability to handle dynamic updates for super classes. This was on ZeroTurnaround's roadmap, and the acquisition will accelerate the availability of this feature.
</blockquote> 
<p><b>Will the Javeleon tool continue to be marketed under that brand, or will it be completely incorporated into JRebel?</b></p> 
<blockquote>
 The Javeleon product will no longer be marketed under that brand. The technology will be integrated with future releases of JRebel.
</blockquote> 
<p>Laats said that they are not yet ready to talk about the future roadmap in terms of timing but wanted users to know that there is a lot of cool technology on the way that will strengthen JRebel's capabilities.</p> 
<p>The terms of the deal have not been disclosed.</p>
