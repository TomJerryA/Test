The framework will continue to be supported for desktops, but the primary focus will be on getting the mobile bit right. The goals also include support for EcmaScript 6 along with a transpiler (since browsers don't support ES6 yet).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The changes planned are outlined in an article &quot;<a href="http://blog.angularjs.org/2014/03/angular-20.html?m=1">AngularJS 2.0</a>&quot; along with links to design documents to elicit feedback from developers.</p>
<p>A brief description about the proposed changes are as follows -</p>
<ul> 
 <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uhs-a41dp2z0NLs-QiXYY-rqLGhgjmTf4iwBad2myzY/edit">Support for ES6</a>&nbsp;along with <a href="https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler">Traceur transpiler</a>. The developer will have the choice to continue writing in ES5.&nbsp;</li> 
 <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10W46qDNO8Dl0Uye3QX0oUDPYAwaPl0qNy73TVLjd1WI/edit">Faster Change Detection</a></li> 
 <li>Instrumention via Angular-wide logging service, diary.js</li> 
 <li>Better modularity</li> 
 <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fTR4TcTGbmExa5w2SRNAkM1fsB9kYeOvfuiI99FgR24/edit">Simpler Dependency Injection</a> - declarative instead of imperative, module loading through ES6 Modules, lazily load parts of JS through child injectors. Most of this design is <a href="https://github.com/angular/di.js">already implemented</a>.</li> 
 <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f5VWROeTI2kJwVKbNsrHuEz5IqtZe14OpoxM9fEYJNU/edit">Templating and Directive improvements</a> - Simpler Directive API, integration with other component frameworks using web standards, improved performance and enabling IDEs to analyze and validate templates</li> 
 <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16Z6Lun15DoWNrE2imk7N-2WiRAaqc954LOfU2-2JSoI/edit">Better Touch animations</a> using native features of browsers supported by fallback; targeting at least 60+ FPS performance)</li> 
 <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I3UC0RrgCh9CKrLxeE4sxwmNSBl3oSXQGt9g3KZnTJI/edit">Improved Routing</a> - Stage based routing, Integration with authentication and authorization, optionally preserving state of some views</li> 
 <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DMacL7iwjSMPP0ytZfugpU4v0PWUK0BT6lhyaVEmlBQ/edit">Better Persistence</a> - support for &quot;always offline&quot; mode with sync to server, especially useful for mobile</li> 
 <li>Support only modern browsers that auto-update - Chrome, FireFox, Opera, Safari and IE11. On mobile, Chrome on Android, iOS 6+, Windows Phone 8+ and Firefox Mobile. There &quot;may&quot; be support for older versions of Android.</li> 
</ul>
<p>Most changes are in design and prototyping stage and the final release might look different from what is proposed right now. You can provide feedback through any of <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/angular">Angular's channels</a>.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br></body></html>
