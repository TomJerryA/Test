But their price advantage lasted for only for 24 hours because the following day <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2014/03/aws-price-reduction-42-ec2-s3-rds-elasticache-and-elastic-mapreduce.html">Amazon slashed the prices for some of their services</a> – EC2, S3, RDS, ElasticCache and MapReduce.</p>
<p>Following is a summary of AWS’ price cuts:</p>

<p>Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon, is the one who posted the price reductions on their website, reminding customers that this is Amazon’s 42<sup>nd</sup> cut since 2008. But, commenting on his <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2014/03/aws-price-reduction-42-ec2-s3-rds-elasticache-and-elastic-mapreduce.html">blog post</a>, some of the readers thanked Google for “reducing our bills.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rightscale.com/blog/cloud-cost-analysis/aws-responds-price-cuts-google-vs-aws-pricing-round-2">RightScale compared AWS’ new prices against Google’s</a>, concluding that they are exactly the same for on-demand standard instances, but Google still has cheaper high-memory and high-cpu instances by 33% and 16% respectively, but AWS high-memory provides 30% more memory and AWS high-cpu has double memory and a SSD, so their offer is actually roughly the same.</p>
<p>When it comes to 1-year reserved instances vs. sustained-use, AWS’ standard and high-memory instances are 10 to 20% cheaper than Google’s 100%-use, while high-cpu ones are more expensive (2-3%). AWS has a major price difference for 3-year reserved instances which are 32-48% cheaper than Google sustained-use. But there is a difference in their models too: one has to pay up-front for AWS reserved instances while Google sustained-use price is calculate as-you-go. RightScale outlined three price advantage scenarios for different types of cloud users:</p>
<blockquote> 
 <ul> 
  <li>For cloud users who have plenty of cash and can accurately predict their usage, AWS RIs can save money.&nbsp;</li> 
  <li>For the many cloud users who are still growing their cloud workloads quickly and leveraging a blend of on-demand and reserved instances, the most cost-effective option will depend on the exact type of instances required and the ability to make effective use of RIs.</li> 
  <li>For cloud users who don’t have a lot of predictability in their workloads and are using primarily on-demand, they will likely save money with Google.</li> 
 </ul>

<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazure/archive/2013/04/16/the-power-of-and.aspx">Microsoft pledged their “commitment to match Amazon Web Services prices</a> for commodity services such as compute, storage and bandwidth,” a year ago when announcing price cuts for some of their Azure services. We kept this article on hold hoping that Microsoft would make a price&nbsp;announcement this week, but nothing came out of Redmond by the time of its publishing.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br></body></html>
