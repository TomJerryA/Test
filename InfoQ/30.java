The library is available as a Portable Class Library, so developers can use as a basis for their own portable libraries.</p>
<p>Internally the MS OpenTech library acts as a wrapper around the native implementations of SQLite that are available for ARM7, x86, and x64 platforms. (Though for .NET 4.5 only <a href="https://sqlitepcl.codeplex.com/documentation">32-bit mode is currently supported</a>.)</p>
<p>The library is available as a <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/SQLitePCL/3.8.2">NuGet package</a> and the <a href="https://sqlitepcl.codeplex.com/documentation">source code</a> was released on CodePlex under the Apache 2 license. SQLite itself has been released in the public domain and has no licensing restrictions.</p>
<p><a href="http://msopentech.com/about/">Microsoft Open Technologies</a> is a subsidiary of Microsoft tasked with maintaining many of their open source projects. Besides SQLite they have a wide variety of projects related to MongoDB, Redis, Apache Cordova, CouchDB, and others. Most deal with either running these third-party technologies on Windows Azure or supporting Microsoft technologies on non-Microsoft platforms such as Eclipse.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br></body></html>
