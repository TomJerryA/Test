<p class="p1"><a href="https://twitter.com/ngalbreath">Nick Galbreath</a>, vice president of engineering for IPONWEB has studied DevOps organizations. He <a href="http://www.darkreading.com/security/application-security/240149897/using-devops-to-upgrade-application-security.html">finds it amazing, that DevOps organizations have a culture that embraces security</a>. The high deploy rates of new code into production those organizations typically show could jeopardize application security. But <a href="https://twitter.com/joshcorman">Josh Corman</a>, director of security intelligence for Akamai Technologies <a href="http://www.darkreading.com/security/application-security/240149897/using-devops-to-upgrade-application-security.html">emphasizes that this approach offers more opportunities to fix issues quickly.</a> He even goes one step further <a href="http://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/it-security-data-protection/cyber-security/rsa-2013-security-today-from-the-white-house-to-the-boardroom/">claiming that complexity is the enemy of stability</a>. And <a href="https://twitter.com/mortman">David Mortman</a>, chief security architect for enStratus, adds that less code leads to less complexity and less security bugs.</p> 
<p class="p1">Another way how <a href="http://devopsangle.com/2013/03/06/how-devops-helps-enhance-application-security/">DevOps supports application security is the possibility to add security unit tests and functional tests, said Mortman</a>. This approach is not new: Nick Galbreath presented this idea at <a href="http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2012-austin/">DevOpsDays Austin 2012</a> during his talk about &quot;<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/nickgsuperstar/devopssec-apply-devops-principles-to-security">DevOpsSec: Appling DevOps Principles to Security</a>&quot;.</p> 
<p class="p1">In his book &quot;<a href="http://itrevolution.com/books/phoenix-project-devops-book/">The Phoenix Project</a>&quot; <a href="https://twitter.com/RealGeneKim">Gene Kim </a>picks the integration of application security into a DevOps culture out as a central theme.</p>
