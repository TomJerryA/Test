<p>Appelo is the creator of the <a href="http://www.management30.com/">Management 3.0</a> and the author of <a href="http://www.noop.nl">The Creative Networker blog.</a></p>
<p>With the new approach, used in Management 3.0 classes, Appelo suggests we need a better understanding of the most relevant intrinsic desires of individuals inside organizations.</p>
<p>Sebastian Radics of <a href="http://www.ontheagilepath.net/2013/11/champfrogs-sketchnotes-from-new.html">on the agile path</a> blog, says that</p>
<blockquote> 
 <p><i>“The 10 intrinsic motivators ...provide a nice orientation on what really motivates us.</i></p> 
 <p><i>Champfrogs helps asking yourself the right questions how to support your environment in getting and sustaining motivation and is for me a key for transforming to a people oriented working place”</i></p> 
</blockquote>
<p>Appelo refers to the checklist as</p>
<blockquote> 
 <p><i>“A simple tool for change agents to match their ideas for change with people's intrinsic motivation and desires”.</i></p> 
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, a tool for team managers, team leaders, coaches, human resources staff and anyone who wants to enrich their knowledge in the area of Change Management.</p>
<p>Since last September, Appelo has published and discussed in detail each one of the items of the Champfrogs Checklist:</p>
