Data Scientists, Lead Architects, and Process Gurus from companies like</p>
<p>Netflix, Facebook, Google, and Twitter shared their successes, failures, and most importantly, lessons learned from building, managing, and growing their large scale systems.</p>
<p>QConSF attendees - Software engineers, Architects, and Project managers from a wide range of industries as well as some prominent Bay-area companies –&nbsp;heard over 100 practitioner speakers present over 100 technical sessions and 19 in-depth tutorials over the course of five days. They also heard keynotes from industry giants like Rich Hickey, Brendan Eich, and Jeff Hammerbacher.</p>
<p>This article summarizes the key takeaways and highlights from QCon San Francisco 2013 as blogged and tweeted by attendees. Over the course of the next 4 months, InfoQ will be <a href="http://www.infoq.com/qconsf-2013">publishing</a> most of the conference sessions online, including 19 video interviews that were recorded by the InfoQ editorial team.

<p>The goal of this workshop was to learn how to build high-performance teams ... what I liked about this workshop is that those guys provided a model that helps us understand the behavior exposed by those very same cultural differences, as well as tools to overcome them.</p>
<p>So what are those impediments? The first one they discussed is the lack of safety. How likely am I going to participate in solving a problem if I don't feel safe enough to speak my mind or take changes, whether it involves a colleague or a supervisor? Of the many tools Amr and Steve shares with us, I liked leveraging your vulnerability. For instance, share your origin story. Where did you come from? What are your goals in life? What choices did you make? Sharing information like that breaks down hierarchies, improves respect and levels the playing field. And if that all feels too soft, consider the foreverness of your current situation. Do you really want to be in this situation forever? Considering that might fuel your sense of safety just enough to do something about it.</p>
<p>The second impediment is lack of respect. How likely am I to participate in solving a problem if you think I'm an idiot? ... An essential mindset when dealing with people is to consider that it is not about how you talk with somebody, but how you see that person. ...&nbsp; Amr claimed that if you don't like somebody, you haven't' talked enough with that person and you should retry. That, and the statement that respect is a gift, was already a key takeaway for me.</p>
<p>The third impediment is lack of intention, or in different words, how likely am I to participate in solving a problem if I don't know what you want? Does that make sense? Because it happened to me many times; getting disappointed or irritated because a co-worker didn't do or behave as I expected, but never realizing that I never told them what I expected in the first place. Suffice to say is being open and clear about what you expect from other people.</p>
<p>The last but not least impediment is lack of ownership. How likely am I to participate in solving a problem if I think it's not my problem? Ownership is a very important phase in a relationship. ... It's really difficult to expect people to take ownership if you don't give them the freedom to make their own choices. Unfortunately there are no easy tools or strategies to overcome this impediment. However, there are ways to work together that increase the chance that somebody does take ownership; agreeing to work by agreement...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dennisdoomen.net/2013/11/qcon-day-1-musicians-google-open-space.html">Dennis Doomen</a> attended this keynote:</p>
<p>He elaborated on a great analogy between software developers and professional musicians. He explained how musicians always start with ideas about short melodies, cadences and rhythms and use that to compose a harmonious song. In our profession that would be the equivalent of creating small autonomous components and use those to 'compose' a system 'in harmony'. If those components end up to be too complex, then you should really work hard to take them apart. Just accept that a large system will eventually end up as too complex to grasp completely. Instead, focus on the small parts first and then look at the bigger picture.</p>
<p>But he even went further with that. He explained us that instruments are always created for experienced musicians, simply because of the fact that you're only a novice for a short time. So why do we still optimize our code for beginners? Just like musicians practice every day, rather than making our 'instruments' (our tools) simpler, we should practice hard as well. Definitely a very inspiring talk, in particular due to the many references to the origins of electronic music (which, as a former fan of Jean-Michel Jarre, really resonated with me).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dennisdoomen.net/2013/11/qcon-day-2-persons-groups-and-teams.html">Dennis Doomen</a> attended this session:</p>
<p>The day started with a <a href="http://qconsf.com/sf2013/keynote/unreasonable-effectiveness-tuning.html">keynote</a> by Keith Adams, a Facebook founding member. He claimed that only 25% of the success of software can be accounted to brilliant teams, tools, frameworks, disciplines and programming languages. The other 75% is added by tuning the system. I'm not sure I fully agree, but I do see that you don't really have a clear understanding of your system's performance until you put it in production. And that's something we do agree on, because he said that if you don't have users, you're not tuning yet (and you shouldn't). I've noticed myself that benchmarks and heuristics don't really give you enough real data to really make your system shine. On the other hand, I think you're already lucky if you managed to pull of a performance or load test in your project. He also started talking on machine learning, but that's a topic that doesn't work for me (yet).</p>

<p>Developers are moving forward on the next two planned versions of ECMAScript, the official specification underlying JavaScript, said Brendan Eich this week. Plans call for the <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/d/application-development/javascript-upgrade-feature-modularization-174251">ECMAScript 6 specification</a> to be done by the end of next year with work in parallel happening on the subsequent ES7 release...</p>
<p>Mozilla's browser support page for ES6 lists numerous programming capabilities planned, including arrow functions and spread operators....</p>
<p>ES7, meanwhile, will have such capabilities as Object.observ, providing a way of observing objects that is not a proxy....</p>
<p>Eich said <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/d/applications/webrtc-browser-communications-standard-has-several-hurdles-clear-208182">WebRTC</a>, a specification equipping browsers with real-time communications apps via JavaScript APIs and HTML5, would become a standard.</p>

<p>The keynote was done by <a href="http://qconsf.com/sf2013/user/brendan-eich.html">Brendan Eich</a>, the inventor of JavaScript, and dealt with the present and future of web development. However, he didn't hide the fact that he was essentially trying to convince us that the next versions of <a href="http://www.ecmascript.org/">EcmaScript</a> are going to be feature rich, performing like race cars, and solve all the issues JavaScript opponents have been throwing at it. In fact, looking at the amount of bullet points on his slides, it is as the JavaScript committee has been trying to add every single feature of every other programming language around. I did notice how well some of the things align with Microsoft's <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>, and support for the <a href="http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2012/07/24/thoughts-on-ecmascript-6-and-new-syntax/">lambda expressions</a> is indeed an awesome little gem. On a side note, he did manage to impress us with something really cool; running <a href="http://www.unrealengine.com/html5/">Unreal in WebGL</a> (provided you have Firefox 22).</p>

<p>The 2nd session of the day was done by a Netflix architect, <a href="https://twitter.com/jedberg">Jeremy Edberg</a>, and dealt with how they managed to get such a scalable and reliable solution, something you would take for granted when using their services. The big 'secret' is that they always design their systems with the assumption that something will go wrong eventually. He mostly showed us how they build custom tools to monitor all their environments, but definitely impressed with the vast amounts of energy they've invested in making their systems so resilient against failures. And now that I think of it, I noticed that all those companies start to create their own tools after they've grown to a certain scale. Definitely something to remember the next time you're looking for an off-the-shelve tool to solve your problem.</p>

<p>One session I did get a lot out of it is the one on how Google has setup their <a href="http://qconsf.com/sf2013/presentation/test-automation-google-scale.html">developer workflow</a>. In our current project we've recently started using feature branches to move towards a more stable trunk. But just imagine the surprise when I learned Google has about 10000 developers all checking in on the trunk about 20 times a minute. But after learning their aggressive testing strategy and how they've optimized their automated build-and-test pipeline I've gained a renewed goal to improve ours as well. They don't even have a traditional QA group anymore. Developers are held responsible and they facilitate the testing efforts by injecting a test engineering professional into each team. In fact, test evangelism is a quintessential aspect of the developer workflow. A good example is the Testing On The Toilet practice, a single page of new ideas and experiences that developers are encouraged to read at the toilet. How's that about dedication...</p>

<p><b><a href="http://qconsf.com/sf2013/presentation/how-github-no-longer-works.html">How GitHub (no longer) Works</a><a name="_Toc374443452"></a> by <a href="http://qconsf.com/sf2013/user/zach-holman.html">Zach Holman</a></b></p>
<p><a href="http://www.dennisdoomen.net/2013/11/qcon-day-3-about-javascript-scaling.html">Dennis Doomen</a> attended this session:</p>
<p>GitHub's <a href="https://twitter.com/holman">Zach Holman</a> shared the many trials and tribulations of moving from a few people to the 250 they have right now. Some of the things they do to deal with the many small and distributed teams are really interesting. As an example, they try to limit the number of meetings that require in-person contact and instead facilitate collaboration by recording all internal talks (they have a dedicated team for that), and providing always-on video conferencing.</p>
<p>But what really struck me is that they don't have any managers. Everything is based on trust. Definitely something a lot of companies can learn from. If you can get your hands on the <a href="http://qconsf.com/sf2013/system/files/presentation-slides/Growing-GitHub-to-250.pdf.html">slides</a>, make sure you check them out. They contain a lot of fresh ideas, but one that really stood out for me is: &quot;Your product should be cutting edge, not your technology&quot;. It really covers the no-nonsense mentality that GitHub is showing.</p>
<p>What's interesting is that GitHub puts a lot of emphasis on their values, even though it has been growing ridiculously. And that's something that resonates well with the stuff <a href="http://qconsf.com/sf2013/user/pedram-keyani.html">Pedram Keyani</a> has been sharing with us in his talk on <a href="http://qconsf.com/sf2013/presentation/evolving-culture-and-values-understanding-tradeoffs-growth-through-failure-importance.html">evolving culture and values</a>. Just like Zach said, you should allow failure as well as define your companies values, even if it means making a tradeoff, and make sure your entire company supports those values. I've never thought about these things, but being part of a company that is growing fast, it's easy to see how much those values can help new employees to understand the culture of the company. In fact, if you're hiring new people, you should be verifying whether that persons aligns well with your values. If you don't, you risk people who are fully disconnected from the company's culture.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dennisdoomen.net/2013/11/qcon-day-3-about-javascript-scaling.html">Dennis Doomen</a> attended this session:</p>
<p>They put a lot of focus on teams and the learning experience. For instance, the teams (5-7 people) get a lot of freedom to execute an assignment in whatever way then want to do it, using whatever process that works for them. They can publicly accept an assignment and then act fully autonomous. Moreover, it's the team itself that is accountable for everything, never the individual person. In fact, bonuses are always granted to the team as well. Only your salary is affected by the individual performance. And if you don't feel comfortable in the team anymore, just apply the &quot;vote with your feet&quot; rule and move to a different team.</p>
<p>Everything else Twitter does is to support those teams. You want to know what the other teams are doing? Just join one of the many Open Beer sessions where teams show each other what they plan to do and when. Or wander through the corridors and look at the posters teams put up to share their plans. You need certain skills? Just talk to the full-time in-house teachers to setup a training (which is then recorded and posted on YouTube for the rest of the world). In fact, Raffi told us that although they do hire a-class developers, they prefer to train the in-house developers instead (which also keeps it interesting for them). In other words, continuous training is part of their values.</p>
<p>So how do they protect the quality of the code? Well, failure is allowed, provided that you learn from that, but hacks are not. Even better, teams are required to spend 10% of their time on removing technical debt. &quot;You don't have technical debt? I don't believe you!&quot; would be Raffi's reaction. Next to that, a global architecture team exists that are there to assist or advice the teams on anything that is required to maintain quality. Raffi told us that Twitter wants to be best company in the world for developers to work for, and I must admit, this does sound like an awesome company that a lot of others can learn from.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dennisdoomen.net/2013/11/qcon-day-2-persons-groups-and-teams.html">Dennis Doomen</a> attended this session:</p>
<p>After lunch I moved to another virtual team related session hosted by <a href="http://www.infoq.com/author/Ashley-Johnson">Ashley Johnson</a>, a very experienced agile coach which proved to be capable of involving the audience in a unique fashion. He basically give the audience short assignments that you were supposed to complete with your neighbor. Even better, at some point he even managed to get an entire row of seats to work together to complete little task. And that's also the most important message of this track. The only way to turn a group of people in a team is to give them a task to complete. That may sound like an open door, but it's quite a fundamental notion that really helped me understand why our teams are still not real teams.</p>
<p>We practice Kanban and use a feature-driven approach. We have been doing Scrum for 45 3-week sprints and decided to move to Kanban to better support the continuous nature of our work. However, now teams are missing some of the pressure they were used to in Scrum and a clear goal/purpose. With the insights from this session it is clear we really need to look at finding a way to reintroduce an explicit task or assignment.</p>
<p>Another great analogy that made me rethink some of our teams issues is to consider what happens if the wheels of a car are not aligned properly. You don't need a engineering degree in the automotive industry to understand that a slight misalignment is enough to really spoil the driving experience. In our project we've introduced a lot of principles, rules and guidelines, but I think we've failed to really help the teams understand why we are doing this. E.g. what's the architectural vision? Why did we need to introduce so much complexity? What kind of challenges are ahead of us that might affect our technical design? I'm definitely going to give some attention to that once I'm back at the office. Oh, Ashley also recommended another book titled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Agile-Adoption-Patterns-Roadmap-Organizational/dp/0321514521">Agile Adoption Patterns</a>.</p>
<p>For the record, the audience agreed that these were important characteristics of the best teams: humility, helping each other, autonomy, tasks, and clear success criteria. Similarly, they also identified some of the worst things a team can suffer from such as: nano management, fear of failure, personal agendas, tasks per person, competition for leadership or an uneven workload.</p>

<p>Part of the same track was a <a href="http://qconsf.com/sf2013/presentation/synergistic-effects-mixed-remoteinhouse-team-can-be-better-sum-its-parts.html">talk</a> by <a href="http://qconsf.com/sf2013/user/dana-caulder.html">Dana Caulder</a> on how they managed to overcome some of the cultural and time zone differences when working with teams in the US and Poland. ... In her experience a successful team knows each other well. So a great tip is to always use the time that you have to wait for each other during meetings to small talk on weekend plans, someone's family, their pets or traditions, or to make jokes. It can really increase the cohesion of the teams. Hopefully my colleagues will not look funny at me the next time I'm asking those kinds of questions...</p>

<p>And just to stay on the JavaScript topic, I also attended a talk on <a href="http://rxjs.codeplex.com/">Reactive Extensions for JavaScript</a>, performed by <a href="http://qconsf.com/sf2013/user/jafar-husain.html">Jafar Husain</a>, an extremely fast-speaking <a href="https://signup.netflix.com/">Netflix</a> architect. It seems that Netflix is doing an impressive job, because a lot of the talks on scalability and high-performance services were done by Netflix developers. Anyway, I was happy to see that somebody finally managed to find some good use for Rx. What I particularly liked about his approach is to think of events as collections that you can execute operations on. ... Oh, and for those .NET developers that have been using Rx for .NET already, the JavaScript version has practically the same API.</p>

<p><a href="http://qconsf.com/sf2013/openspace.html">QCon Open Space Events</a><a name="_Toc374443473"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.dennisdoomen.net/2013/11/qcon-day-1-musicians-google-open-space.html">Dennis Doomen</a> attended an Architecture Open Space event:</p>
<p>The slot just before lunch was reserved for an <a href="http://qconsf.com/sf2013/openspace.html">Open Space</a> on architecture. As somebody who really spends a great deal of my time on agile and architecture, I can tell you it was a great experience. First I joined a discussion on agile architecture and how to get the business to understand how important bringing down technical debt is, and why we need time to work on architectural changes. I was glad to hear that this challenge is a universal problem in our profession (and not only mine :-)). The main take away for me was that you should really try to avoid running in stealth mode and spend more energy explaining the business the cost of technical debt.</p>
<p>I couldn't resist proposing a discussion on Event Sourcing and using it to build occasionally connected system. It was fun to explain a group of experienced architects how and why we used events as a unit of synchronization. The big question was whether I would choose this architecture style again, provided similar requirements. But after some contemplating, my answer is 'most definitely yes'. However, I did emphasize the fact that I underestimated the complexity it introduces, even though I've been<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/dennisdoomen/building-occasionally-connected-applications-using-event-sourcing">talking</a> about this topic for several years now.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dennisdoomen.net/2013/11/qcon-day-2-persons-groups-and-teams.html">Dennis Doomen</a> proposed an Open Space event on feeling responsible:</p>
<p>My last session of the day involved another Open Space discussion. I proposed a topic on how to promote the pride of ownership within the teams, as well as encourage developers to feel more responsible of the code base as well as the product. I was lucky to have both Dana and Ashley in our little group. Ashley provided some background on the psychology behind the responsibility of people and basically told us that it is very hard to make people feel responsible for their choices from the outside. It should come from the person him/herself as part of moving through the stages of a <a href="http://www.christopheravery.com/responsibility-process">responsibility process</a>. However, generally people feel responsible for the choices that they made themselves or things they've opted in. Obviously that resonates well with Ashley's earlier observation that tasks help transforming groups of people into a team.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dennisdoomen.net/2013/11/qcon-day-3-about-javascript-scaling.html">Dennis Doomen</a> attended an Open Space event on cultural diversity:</p>
<p>I attended two discussions of which the first tried to identify ways to solve different levels of skills within the teams. We concluded that the more common solutions like brown paper sessions, peer reviews and pair programming can really help, at the end of the day, it's much better to accept the differences and allow room for failures.</p>
<p>The other one was proposed by myself to get some feedback on how to help team members that are afraid to ask questions, or are too much focused on solving a problem without verifying they are actually solving the right problem. To overall consensus is that you should start recognizing the differences, asking specific questions and to try to understand the people in your teams on a personal or private level. One way to do that is to organize a kind of recess outside the confines of the office to meet up with other colleagues and talk about the job, the company or whatever you like. <a href="http://qconsf.com/sf2013/user/dana-caulder.html">Dana Caulder</a> also pointed out that triggering people to ask two questions about something that cause them confusion might help break through the often seen &quot;Yes, I'm doing fine. I fully understand&quot;. Another thing that I'm trying to do myself a bit more often is get back at people after a meeting to see if there were any concerns or questions, especially for those that find it difficult to speak out in a large group.</p>

<p>The seventh annual QCon San Francisco brought together close to 1,000 attendees and more than 100 speakers in what was the largest ever QCon to be held in the US.</p>
<p>QCon's focus on practitioner-driven content is reflected in the fact that the program committee that selects the talks and speakers is itself comprised of technical practitioners from the software development community.
