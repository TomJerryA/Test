Known as <a href="http://xamlspy.com/learn/xaml-spy-express">XAML Spy Express</a>, this product allows developers to browse the visual tree of a running application. Unlike its open source competitor, <a href="http://snoopwpf.codeplex.com/">Snoop</a>, XAML Spy supports Silverlight, Windows Store, and Windows Phone in addition to WPF. Note that examining Silverlight 3/4 apps requires having Silverlight 5 installed.</p>
<p>XAML Spy also offers a commercial version. That version adds the ability to edit properties much like a web browserâ€™s built-in HTML/CSS debugger. It can also serialize a control back to the XAML that represents its current state.</p>
<p>Both the free and commercial version of XAML Spy 2 are integrated into Visual Studio. XAML debugging is enabled simply by right-clicking on the project file. There is, however, a performance hit from this so they provide a way to easily disable it as well. And by default it is limited to debug builds only.</p>
<p>If you prefer to use a stand-alone XAML debugger, XAML Spy 1 is still available. This can be installed side-by-side with XAML Spy 2 and allows developers to attach to any running WPF application. An internal web browser is used for debugging Silverlight applications. In a future update XAML Spy 2 is expected to regain the ability to run outside of Visual Studio.</p>
<p>XAML Spy relies on what they call the <a href="http://xamlspy.com/learn/spyservice">XAML Spy service</a>. Running applications and debuggers communicate with each other via this service. Unfortunately firewalls and VPN connections can interfere with this service, sometimes even after the VPN connection is dropped.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br></body></html>
