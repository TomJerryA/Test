The Unity.Mvc3 and Unity.WebAPI projects were <a href="$Paul Hiles">previously run by DevTrends</a>. These open source libraries allow for integration between ASP.NET MVC &amp; Web API and Microsoftâ€™s IoC framework, Unity. The version targeting ASP.NET MVC 4, known as <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Unity.Mvc4">Unity.Mvc4</a>, was based on Unity.Mvc3 but run by an independent developer.</p>
<p>As part of taking over the project, FeedbackHound has updated the code to work with ASP.NET MVC 5 and Web API 2. The code, which has been moved to GitHub, now depends on.NET 4.5 and Unity 3. Older versions will continue to be available on CodePlex.</p>
<p>As part of this update there has been a slight change to the way Unity is registered. Developers are now supposed to add a call to UnityConfig.RegisterComponents inside the Application_Start event. This call hooks into a matching UnityConfig.cs file placed in the App_Start folder when the libraries are installed via NuGet.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br></body></html>
