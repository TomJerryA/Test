<p>In order to make their services accessible to users and developers without depending on carriers to upgrade the software, Google continues to&nbsp;push some of the functionality, usually provided as separate applications, into Play Services. This time they added a developer preview API for accessing an userâ€™s Drive in order to read or write files. This API works in offline mode too, changes to a file being synchronized with Drive when the user reconnects. Drive API includes a couple of customized UI components developers can use: file picker and save dialog.</p>
<p>Another feature coming&nbsp;in 4.1 is support for turn-based multiplayer games. Developers can now create such games for 2 to 8 players, the Play game API doing the synchronization across all devices via Play Services.</p>
<p>Also, the location-based Google Mobile Ads SDK, introduced&nbsp;in <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2013/11/google-play-services-4">Play Services 4.0</a>,&nbsp;now fully supports several ad solutions that were partially supported in the beginning: DoubleClick for Publishers, DoubleClick Ad Exchange, and Search Ads for Mobile Apps.</p>
<p>Play Services 4.1 will be available for download after devices across the world have been updated to include it. Developers must wait a week or so before being able to download the SDK.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br></body></html>
