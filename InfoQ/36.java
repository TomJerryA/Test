They facilitated a workshop at the </span><a href="http://www.sepg.unicom.co.uk/" style="font-size: 12px;">SEPG Europe 2013</a><span style="font-size: 12px;"> conference where they explored security activities and presented the </span><a href="http://cmmiinstitute.com/resource/security-by-design-with-cmmi-for-development-version-1-3/" style="font-size: 12px;">Application Guide for Improving Processes for Secure Products</a><span style="font-size: 12px;">.</span></p>
<p>Winfried and Peter asked the workshop attendants to come up with&nbsp;dedicated development activities that need to be done to enhance security and to create a more secure product. They categorized the&nbsp;ideas that the attendants brought up:</p>
<blockquote> 
 <p>Organization:</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Arrange for security experts</li> 
  <li>Increase security awareness and develop a security culture</li> 
  <li>Provide security training</li> 
  <li>Develop and deploy security policies</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>Requirements:</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Identify hackers as stakeholders</li> 
  <li>Do a security risk analysis</li> 
  <li>Define security requirements, e.g. with security user stories and scenarios</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>Architecture</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Focus on security risks in interface design</li> 
  <li>Architecture rules and guidelines for security</li> 
  <li>Identify and apply proven architectures for security</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>Implementation</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Apply coding standards for secure software</li> 
  <li>Use tooling to check code on security</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>Testing</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Plan and do security testing</li> 
  <li>Use tools to automate security testing</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>Full Life Cycle</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Perform security reviews and verifications</li> 
  <li>Identify risk sources and categories to do a risk assessment</li> 
  <li>Apply lessons learned from other companies and communities</li> 
  <li>Establish social media policies for dealing with security issues</li> 
 </ul>

<p>Earlier this year the CMMI Institute published the <a href="http://cmmiinstitute.com/resource/security-by-design-with-cmmi-for-development-version-1-3/">Application Guide for Improving Processes for Secure Products</a>.&nbsp; This application guide&nbsp;contains&nbsp;additional process areas&nbsp;about security aspects of engineering,&nbsp; managing security in projects, and organizational security topics. The guide&nbsp;can be used with the&nbsp;Capability Maturity Model Integration for Development (CMMI-DEV) to improve processes so that organizations using them can provide security assurance for their customer.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://cmmiinstitute.com/">CMMI Institute</a> together with the authors of the guide&nbsp;would like to hear from organizations that have used the guide, and&nbsp;they welcome any feedback.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br></body></html>
