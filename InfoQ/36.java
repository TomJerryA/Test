This package allows developers using .NET 4, Silverlight 4, and Windows Phone 7.5 to use the async features found in C# 5 and VB 11.</p> 
<p>The package consists of three libraries: Microsoft.Bcl, Microsoft.Bcl.Async, and Microsoft.Bcl.Build. Due to the way that <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/db7849ey.aspx">assembly unification</a> is used, all projects in the solution need to reference all three libraries</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.CompilerServices.AsyncTargetingPack">Microsoft.Bcl.Async</a> supersedes the Async Targeting Pack, which has been delisted from NuGet.</p>
