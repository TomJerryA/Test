<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Microsoft's S. Somasegar lists the five areas specifically targetted for enhancement with this release:</p> 
<blockquote> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Agile planning</li> 
  <li>Quality enablement</li> 
  <li>Windows Store development</li> 
  <li>Line-of-business development</li> 
  <li>General developer experience</li> 
 </ul> 
</blockquote> 
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">Agile planning support is addressed with the new ability to customize the Kanban board, and the ability to use tags on TFS work items. </span><span lang="en-US">Quality enablement is the phrase Somasegar uses to refer to quality assurance and software testing related functionality. Improvements here include greater unit testing support for areas such as Windows Phone 8 apps, aysnchronous code, and improved support for SharePoint 2013 testing. Windows Store development primarily benefits from improved JavaScript app diagnostics. Line-of-business application enhancements are focused around LightSwitch and Blend. </span><span lang="en-US">Further, as <a class="western" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2013/02/18/announcing-release-of-asp-net-and-web-tools-2012-2-update.aspx">Scott Guthrie noted</a>, the </span><span lang="en-US">separately released </span><span lang="en-US">ASP.NET and Web Tools Update is also part of Update 2 </span><span lang="en-US">saving a separate download if it has not already been downloaded</span><span lang="en-US">.</span></p> 
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">Beyond all of the features that are included, several issues and bugs discovered in previous iterations of VS2012 have been fixed. Details on these corrected issues is <a class="western" href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2797912">available here</a>. </span><span lang="en-US">Microsoft's Charles Sterling <a class="western" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudioalm/archive/2013/04/04/visual-studio-update-2-now-available.aspx">illustrates</a> some of the ALM features in Update 2, and one new feature of particular importance is TFS2012's compatibility with 2010 build servers. Configuring this arrangement is described in detail by </span><span lang="en-US"><a class="western" href="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/visual-studio-2012-update-2-supports-2010-build-servers/">Martin Hinshelwood's blog post</a>. Finally, Brian Harry <a class="western" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bharry/archive/2013/04/04/vs-tfs-2012-2-update-2-released-today.aspx">notes</a> that with Update 2 most (but not all) of the TFS settings are preserved during the upgrade from TFS Update 1 to Update 2.</span></p> 
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">Update 2 is a cumulative release, meaning that includes all of the benfits of <a class="western" href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2012/11/vs2012update1_released;jsessionid=50E06713E5C35D43DC484DF9866131E0">Update 1</a> so a fresh installation of VS2012 may be directly upgraded without first installing Update 1. An ISO image for installation on non-Internet connected machines is not provided but Microsoft has provided a work-around</span><span lang="en-US">-- running the Update 2 executable with the &quot;/layout&quot; option which will download all of the files necessary for offline installations </span><span lang="en-US">(Step by step instructions are listed at the bottom of Update 2's <a class="western" href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=38188">download page</a>)</span><span lang="en-US">. While no formal size is given by Microsoft my local installation indicates roughly 1.8 GB of space is required.</span></p>
