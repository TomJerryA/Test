 <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="Standard">This joins another change in how generic types are handled benefitting scenarios such as “fully-typed generic promise typings”.&nbsp; Another important addition is that the library <code>lib.d.ts</code> file bundled with TypeScript has been updated to provide touch and WebGL support.
 <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="Standard">While overall feedback to this release is positive, this is still a release candidate and it should not be installed on a critical production system unless you are willing to assume some risks.&nbsp; Some early adopters are indicating that there are still a few stability to bugs that need to be squashed.&nbsp; 
 <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="Standard">Besides access via Update 2, TypeScript 1.0RC can also be downloaded and used as a <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/#Download">standalone tool</a>.&nbsp; The project’s full source code is maintained on <a href="http://typescript.codeplex.com/sourcecontrol/latest#README.txt">Codeplex</a>.&nbsp; Outside of Visual Studio, TypeScript enjoys support on <a href="https://github.com/palantir/eclipse-typescript">Eclipse</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Railk/T3S">Sublime</a> among other popular text editors.
