 As we expected, there has been a global outpouring of interest for the 200 or so speaker slots for AGILE2014. This is a highly competitive process because it’s such a remarkable opportunity to share your knowledge with Agilists across the world. There’s still time to submit, and if you have a topic, I encourage you to participate.
