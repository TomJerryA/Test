<p>The latest version of Slick, a Functional-Relational Mapping, FRM, library for Scala, comes with reverse-engineering of database schemas and new driver architecture to allow support for non-SQL databases. Changes in the recently released version 2.0 include:</p>
<ul> 
 <li>A code generator that reverse-engineers a database schema, generating all code required.</li> 
 <li>New driver architecture to enable support for non-SQL, non-JDBC databases.</li> 
 <li>Removal of the flat tuples restriction in table definitions, allowing usage of any type valid as a Query return type.</li> 
 <li>Support of heterogeneous lists for records of arbitrary size in addition to Scala tuples.</li> 
 <li>A new model for pre-compiled queries has replaced the old QueryTemplate abstraction.</li> 
 <li>Besides querying, pre-compiled queries can now also be used for update and delete operations.</li> 
 <li>Soft inserts as the default, removing the need for separate projections for inserts. The old behaviour is still supported.</li> 
 <li>New and more verbose syntax table definitions in the Lifted Embedding standard API to avoid pitfalls in earlier versions.</li> 
 <li>Support for server-side Option conversions.</li> 
 <li>An experimental feature which allows for Query scheduling, allowing usage of tables from multiple databases in a single query.</li> 
 <li>A new Activator template aiming at simplifying getting started with Slick.</li> 
</ul>
<p>In addition to these updates, more than 200 changes are included in the new release. The team have also updated the documentation, including a new getting started guide. This release is not backward compatible, a guide for migration describes the changes from 1.0.</p>
<p>Slick is a relational database access library for the functional language Scala; corresponding to an Object-Relational Mapper, ORM, for object-oriented languages, e.g. Hibernate.<br /> A mailing list for Slick users is available with more than 700 members.</p>
<p>Slick is an open source product with a BSD-style license. Supported database systems include H2, MySQL and PostgreSQL. Drivers for Oracle, IBM DB2, and Microsoft SQL Server are available through a closed-source extension.</p>
