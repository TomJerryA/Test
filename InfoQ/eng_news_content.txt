<p>The latest version of the Akka toolkit comes with persistence enabling stateful actors to persist their internal state. The recently released version 2.3.0 is also prepared for support of Java 8 lambda expressions.</p>
<p>In Akka persistence, instead of current state, each change to an actor’s state are persisted. Changes are appended to a journal and an actors’ internal state can be rebuilt by replaying the stored changes. Support for event sourcing and at-least-once message deliveries is also provided.<br /> Using Java 8 and lambda expressions, both Actors and Finite State Machines (FSM) may now be implemented using lambda syntax thus removing the need for declaring anonymous inner classes.<br /> Both the persistence module and the lambda support are marked as <em>experimental</em> with an ambition to improve the API based on feedback from users.</p>
<p>Other improvements include:</p>
<ul> 
 <li>A cluster can from being partially unreachable now come back to working as normally again with the failure condition cleared when the affected nodes becomes responsive.</li> 
 <li>Cluster sharding can be used to distribute stateful actors over several nodes when the actors consume more resources than one machine can supply.</li> 
 <li>Removal of the experimental label from Akka IO package, but with the Pipeline infrastructure discontinued.</li> 
 <li>The OSGi support has been reworked to make akka-actor an OSGi bundle.</li> 
</ul>
<p>The documentation together with a getting started guide has been updated to reflect the changes in the framework. Akka is also part of a larger sample of a reactive platform.<br /> The new release contains some structural modifications requiring code changes when upgrading from 2.2.*. Upgrading from earlier version may require some extra steps.</p>
<p>The Akka toolkit is an implementation of the Actor Model, available with both a Java and a Scala API. This 2.3 release is the first step in a larger milestone planned for second half of 2014.<br /> Akka is an open source product, licensed under the Apache 2 License.</p>
<p> Vaughn Vernon, author of Implementing Domain-Driven Design, talked last year about actor model in reactive domain-driven design and in an earlier talk about the foundation for actor model together with DDD.</p>
<p>A forum for Akka users is available with more than 3000 members.</p>
