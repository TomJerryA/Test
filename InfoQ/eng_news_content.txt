In order to make their services accessible to users and developers without depending on carriers to upgrade the software, Google continues to&nbsp;push some of the functionality, usually provided as separate applications, into Play Services. This time they added a developer preview API for accessing an userâ€™s Drive in order to read or write files. This API works in offline mode too, changes to a file being synchronized with Drive when the user reconnects. Drive API includes a couple of customized UI components developers can use: file picker and save dialog.
