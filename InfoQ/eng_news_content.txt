<p class="Standard">Microsoft’s open source language TypeScript is designed to make large-scale JavaScript application development easier while providing the benefits of modern tooling.&nbsp; The latest release candidate for the upcoming 1.0 release brings several changes to TypeScript since its previous 0.95 edition.&nbsp; Foremost among the changes is new handling of generics.&nbsp; The development team has changed the behavior of the “any” keyword.&nbsp; This has been done in an effort to simplify the type-checking performed when creating interfaces and subclasses.&nbsp; 
 <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="Standard">This joins another change in how generic types are handled benefitting scenarios such as “fully-typed generic promise typings”.&nbsp; Another important addition is that the library <code>lib.d.ts</code> file bundled with TypeScript has been updated to provide touch and WebGL support.

<p class="Standard">While overall feedback to this release is positive, this is still a release candidate and it should not be installed on a critical production system unless you are willing to assume some risks.&nbsp; Some early adopters are indicating that there are still a few stability to bugs that need to be squashed.&nbsp; 
 <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="Standard">Besides access via Update 2, TypeScript 1.0RC can also be downloaded and used as a standalone tool.&nbsp; The project’s full source code is maintained on Codeplex.&nbsp; Outside of Visual Studio, TypeScript enjoys support on Eclipse and Sublime among other popular text editors.
