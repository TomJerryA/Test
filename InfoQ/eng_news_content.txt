<p class="p1">Curoverse and Tute Genomics secured $1.5 million each in seed funding in the past month aiming to bring gene sequencing to the masses. Curoverse is a private cloud platform for the biomedical industry. Curoverse is backing <span class="s1">Arvados</span>, the open source bioinformatics platform. Tute genomics is offering a cloud based genome analysis solution, helping researchers interpret sequenced data from human exome and even genome.</p>
<p class="p2">Gene sequencing costs have <span class="s1">slashed</span> in the past years, making it easier to market the service to a larger audience. In the meanwhile, storage and computing power have increased following <span class="s1">Moore’s law</span>, making it easier to analyze and store the full genome of a human being.</p>
<p class="p2">But still, a fully sequenced human genome is in the range of 100-1,000 GB of data. A million customers’ data can add up to an exabyte or around 1,000,000 TB of data. Researchers from UC Berkeley have proposed a feasible way to manage this <span class="s1">database</span> using a three tiered storage approach of 100 PB, one petabyte and one terabyte out of which only the last one would be RDBMS based. The holy grail for this effort is <span class="s1">personalized medicine</span>. Humans share <span class="s1">99.9% of DNA</span> and the hypothesis is that analyzing the full genome sequence for many patients will discover what is hiding in this 0.1% that can be used to predict and cure many diseases including cancer.</p>
<p class="p2">On the computing power side, specialized hardware is being used to <span class="s1">analyze genome data faster</span>. The cost of sequencing human genome has dropped <span class="s1">100,000 time fold</span> in the past 10 years and the time to analyze it has fallen from <span class="s1">13 years to less than three days</span>.</p>
<p class="p2">In the research world, there are already sequencing centers analyzing and storing <span class="s1">data</span>, each from a small number of patients. The real challenge is combining these datasets across different archives and <span class="s1">cross referencing</span> them with patient records, treatments and outcomes.</p>
<p class="p2">Throughout the past years, private companies have stepped in and started offering genome analysis for the masses. Organizations like <span class="s1">Illumina</span>,&nbsp;Seven Bridges Genomics, <span class="s1">Complete Genomics</span> and others are offering researchers and private parties the opportunity to map the full genome sequence for a four figure quote. Illumina recently announced <span class="s1">HiSeq X Ten</span>, promising the <span class="s1">long-awaited</span> &nbsp;$1,000 genome sequencing.</p>
<p class="p2">Illumina has launched a cloud computing and storage platform called <span class="s1">BaseSpace</span>, allowing scientists to sequence, analyze and collaborate on data that are being stored in <span class="s1">Amazon Web Services</span>. Bioinformatics applications can also be developed using their <span class="s1">API and SDKs</span>.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Seven Bridges Genomics</span>, on the other hand, is using a combination of cloud and NoSQL database technologies like EC2, S3 and <span class="s1">MongoDB</span> for human genome sequencing and <span class="s1">analysis</span>. Glacier is also used to bring down data storage costs. Seven Bridges PaaS provides a GUI to setup data pipelines which can be based off predefined models or modified to fit the task at hand.</p>
<p class="p2">For the aspiring bioinformatics developers, <span class="s1">Crossbow</span> is one of the tools that can be used for whole genome resequencing <span class="s1">analysis</span>. By combining several libraries it can analyze a human genome in under three hours for less than $100 in AWS. Intel offers a step-by-step <span class="s1">guide</span> and the source code can be found in <span class="s1">GitHub</span>.</p>
<p class="p1">The $15 <span class="s1">billion</span> genomic research industry is just starting to heat up and advances in technology will extend the notion of <span class="s1">quantified self</span> farther than what we have seen up until today.</p>
