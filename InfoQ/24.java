<p>EF 6 was affected by <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2013/11/ef-6-performance-issues">slow startup time and entity materialization issues</a>. These are <a href="https://entityframework.codeplex.com/workitem/1778">reported</a> <a href="https://entityframework.codeplex.com/workitem/1829">fixed</a> in 6.1 along with other performance improvements such as faster view generation in more scenarios and optimizations for null equality comparison in LINQ queries. Apart from this, several improvements have been made -</p>
<ul> 
 <li>An <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/data/jj591583#Index">Index Attribute</a> - Allows creation of indexes on one or more columns when using EF Code-First. Supports both unique and non-unique indexes.&nbsp;</li> 
 <li>A <a href="https://entityframework.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Public%20Mapping%20API">Public Mapping API</a> - which enables developers to get access to the mapping metadata.</li> 
 <li><a href="https://entityframework.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Handling%20of%20Transaction%20Commit%20Failures%20&amp;version=13">Handling of Transaction Commit Failures</a> - network failures during commits can be tricky and stop the application from knowing whether the transaction was successfully committed on the server; if the operation is idempotent, you can retry it easily, but if it is not, then there needs to be a way to check with the server whether the transaction did commit. This new feature enables this with just a config change. And it works with the retries feature introduced in EF 6.<br /> <br /> Note that this feature uses a table to store commit information, which might need to be purged manually.</li> 
 <li>Support For ToString, String.Concat and enum HasFlags in LINQ Queries</li> 
 <li>Easier debugging with the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/data/jj556606#Interceptors">ability to configure intercepters via app/web config</a> and a couple of new interceptors (DatabaseLogger and IDbTransactionInterceptor)</li> 
 <li><a href="https://entityframework.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Tooling%20Consolidation">Tooling consolidation</a> - a single entry point for creating any data model (Designer, Code-first, import from database)</li> 
</ul>
