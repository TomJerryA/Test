<p class="MsoNormal">Developers that use tags in TFS will find significant usability enhancements in how tags are handled after applying this update.&nbsp; Notably tags can now be queried, work items can be tagged, and permissions can be set on who can create new tags.&nbsp; This makes tags more than just a visual indicator, and the addition of permissions will manage their use while minimize typos.

<p class="MsoNormal">Profiling receives a couple of updates too.&nbsp; The first is a new CPU Usage tool that provides a way to explore which functions are using the CPU (managed, native, and JavaScript).&nbsp; The previously introduced diagnostic hub now allows multiple tools to be concurrently, and the results are combined so that a single timeline can show CPU usage, energy consumption, and UI responsiveness (depending on what has been selected.) &nbsp;Update 2 also includes a new JSON Visualizer for the Visual Studio debugger and works with all the languages that the debugger supports.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">According to Microsoft’s Brian Harry, a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bharry/archive/2014/02/05/vs-tfs-2013-2-update-2-ctp-released.aspx">future CTP</a> for Update 2 will bring expand the Update’s offerings even more by delivering additional features for Git, including support for annotate, reverting commits, and the ability to push/pull from multiple remote repositories.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are a couple of known issues when using this CTP, so care should be taken when exploring the update.&nbsp; Furthermore, Microsoft installation instructions note a difference in how this CTP is applied to VS2013 versus TFS2013.&nbsp; TFS2013 users are strongly encouraged to take a full backup of their current database prior to installation as a there is no ability to perform a rollback if installation is unsuccessful.&nbsp; For full details <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2927432">consult</a> the CTP’s Knowledge Base article.
