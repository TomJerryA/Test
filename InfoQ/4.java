<p>WSO2 has recently <a href="http://wso2.com/about/news/wso2-developer-studio-adds-significant-new-capabilities-to-support-development-and-integration-with-the-wso2-esb/">announced</a>&nbsp;two new&nbsp;releases of their <a href="http://wso2.com/products/developer-studio/">Developer Studio IDE, 3.0 and 3.1</a>&nbsp;(WSO2 DS). The initial plan was to release a major version, but they managed to follow up with a minor release a week later, adding some improvements requested by customers.</p> 
<p>WSO2 DS continues the trend established with the <a href="http://wso2.com/about/news/new-wso2-developer-studio-2-0-is-first-ide-for-developing-an-application-once-and-deploying-it-both-on-premise-and-in-the-cloud">2.0 release</a>, streamlining application development for <a href="http://wso2.com/products/carbon/">Carbon</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://wso2.com/cloud/stratos/">Stratos</a>.

 <li>WSO2 ESB Task support&nbsp;– used to set up recurring tasks that are also packaged in the CAR</li>
