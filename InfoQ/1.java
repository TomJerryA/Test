Coming after the <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2013/09/Trevor_Eckhart_CarrieIQ_RootKit" target="_blank">Trevor Eckhart interview</a>, it affords the international company an opportunity to respond to any negative community perception of their applications. Of which the current product names are <a href="http://www.carrieriq.com/iq-xplore/" target="_blank">iQ xPlore</a> and <a href="http://www.carrieriq.com/documents/19-february-2013-carrier-iq-reinvents-customer-care-with-iq-care/11071/" target="_blank">iQ Care</a>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">1. What if anything have the Trevor Eckhart disclosures done to change Carrier IQ's views on protecting the private data of smart phone users?</span></strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS';">
  <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>
 In 2011 Trevor Eckhart found logs on his device that he believed were associated with Carrier iQ data.&nbsp;
 <span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>Our response at the time, which has since been confirmed by a detailed FTC investigation, is that the data collection logs were associated with and used by the manufacturer of the device, not Carrier iQ.&nbsp;
 <span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>They were not Carrier iQ logs.
 <span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS';">
  <o:p></o:p></span> 
 <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">In terms of our views on the privacy of smart phone users, our views have not changed.&nbsp;<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>We have consistently believed that mobile device users deserve strong privacy protections including transparency, data minimization and appropriate security measures.&nbsp;<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>This has never changed and we continue to prioritize improving and implementing <a href="http://www.carrieriq.com/privacy/" target="_blank">privacy protections</a> for our customers.</span></p>

What is your position on the<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span></strong><a href="http://info.publicintelligence.net/DHS-FBI-AndroidThreats.pdf" target="_blank"><strong><span style="font-family:Arial;color:#084DE5">DHS' Roll Call Report</span></strong></a><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;"> characterization of Carrier IQ as malware?</span></strong></p>
<blockquote>
 That so called report is so erroneous and flawed that it appears there was no real research or expertise that went into drafting it.&nbsp;
 <span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>It is likely the reason it has gained very little traction within the established software security community.&nbsp;
 <span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>The author(s) never contacted us and it is clear they had no comprehension of what our offering accomplishes.&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Arial;">3. Is Carrier IQ a root kit?</span></strong></p>
<blockquote>
 Carrier iQ's iQ Agent is not a root kit. The general definition of a 
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootkit" target="_blank">root kit</a>, as highlighted by Wikipedia, is
 <span style="font-family:
Arial;color:#1A1A1A">&nbsp;a set of software tools that enable an unauthorized user to gain control of a computer system without being detected.&nbsp;<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>That's not what we do.&nbsp;<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>Our iQ Agent does not, and has never, allowed unauthorized access to any device nor has it ever allowed the data from any device to be accessed or used by an unauthorized party.&nbsp;</span>
</blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">4. What do you see as the proper role of root kits in the software world?</span></strong></p>
<blockquote>
 We are not involved in root kits, so it is not a relevant question for us.&nbsp;

 Our focus, every day, is to help our customers create the most positive and stable mobile experience for consumers.&nbsp;
 <span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>We believe users have the right to use whichever apps they choose on their device.&nbsp;
 <span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>However, if users are looking to improve their device security or prevent unauthorized access to their data, using ID Carrier IQ will not serve that intended purpose.&nbsp;
</blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">6. How do you go about qualifying a potential Carrier IQ customer?</span></p>
<blockquote>
 We have been expanding our target market and we enjoy a geographically diverse customer base.&nbsp;
 <span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>One of our areas of focus with our customers is to partner with them to ensure they understand the privacy mechanisms we employ and to assist them in fully leveraging those mechanisms, including customization of consent features.&nbsp;
 <span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>Our shared goal with our customers is to facilitate a transparent, privacy protective and consumer friendly delivery of services.&nbsp;
</blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">7. Do you have any advice for software developers on how to protect their app users' private data?</span></strong></p>
<blockquote>
 Our Carrier iQ team has the benefit of a privacy expert who is an established leader in creating comprehensive privacy programs.&nbsp;
 <span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>We believe every organization should follow our lead and, regardless of size, establish an appropriate privacy program, educate its personnel on data protection measures and implement policy and technical protections it employs for customers.&nbsp;
 <span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>For example, privacy reviews should be incorporated into the product lifecycle.&nbsp;
 <span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>And of course, there are applicable laws and regulatory guidelines that should be understood and implemented.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">At Carrier iQ we have built in privacy protection into all of our practices across the company and throughout our solutions.</span>&nbsp;</p>
