With the help of zero hardware restrictions, you will be able to debug on the majority of devices irrespective of hardware, vendor restrictions and license checks. Moreover, the latest release includes custom built scripts to support C/C++, Java and resource generation with dependency tracking and minimal rebuilds on every stage of deployment.</p>
<p>Android++ provides customisable compiler options and enables you to choose between LLVM/<a href="http://clang.llvm.org/">Clang</a> or GCC-based source compilation. It also includes support for <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Precompiled-Headers.html">Pre-Compiled Header</a> (PCH) and parallel compilation including device and emulator source-level debugging from within Visual Studio. The extension also enables developers to automatically deploy and run applications in addition to attaching to an existing running process.</p>
<p>Android++ helps you to build Android application using Visual Studio and is oriented for <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html">NDK</a> based C/C++ applications with support for customisable deployment, resource management and integrated Java source compilation.</p>
<p>In order to work with the Android++ <a href="http://android-plus-plus.com/download/">extension</a>, you require access to either Microsoft Visual Studio 2010, 2012 or 2013. However, the extension doesn't provide support for Visual Studio express edition. As of the time of this writing, Android++ is available in closed beta only for developers with prior experience in Android. While the developer has not indicated any specific time frame for the public release, the extension will most likely be available in a staggered manner over the next few weeks.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br></body></html>
