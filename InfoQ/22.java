In the past companies were asked setup an Active Directory or pay 3,000 per hundred computers for side-loading keys. As part of the Windows 8.1 Update that requirement has been considerably softened.</p>
<p>Under the new rules, companies with Open License agreements can <a href="http://blogs.windows.com/windows/b/business/archive/2014/04/02/building-the-mobile-workplace-with-windows-and-windows-phone.aspx">purchase a Multiple Activation Key for approximately 100 dollars</a>. This key, also known as a MAK, is needed for any Windows 8.1 RT, Pro, or Enterprise computers not part of a domain. Windows 8.1 Pro or Enterprise computers that are part of a domain can <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh852635.aspx">sideload apps by following the directions on TechNet</a>. Standard versions of Windows 8.x only support sideloading if it is outfitted as a developer’s rig.</p>
<p>Other problems with using WinRT apps in the enterprise continue to persist. Aside from the obvious lack of support for older machines running Windows 7, there still isn’t a good way to distribute WinRT apps within the enterprise. <a href="http://www.lhotka.net/weblog/Windows8SideLoadingImprovements.aspx">Rockford Lhotka</a> writes about three options,</p>

 <p>Microsoft offers InTune, which is a full MDM (mobile device management) product. If you find the value proposition of an MDM compelling then InTune is probably the right answer for you – though there’s a per device/per month cost (ranging from $6/device/month to $11/device/month) so you don’t get MDM for free of course.</p> 
 <p>I’ve been coordinating an open source project called <a href="http://www.lhotka.net/weblog/ct.ashx?id=3a6efc45-380d-4b21-aa4c-09f536cd9aed&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fgithub.com%2fmagenic%2forgportal">OrgPortal</a> that you can use to (relatively) easily create an app store for your organization.</p> 
 <p>There’s another open source project called <a href="http://www.lhotka.net/weblog/ct.ashx?id=3a6efc45-380d-4b21-aa4c-09f536cd9aed&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fcompanystore.codeplex.com">CompanyStore</a> that is very similar.</p>
