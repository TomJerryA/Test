JetBrains has decided to extract the respective functionality and place it in an IDE of its own, namely <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/dbe/">0xDBE</a>.</p>
<p>0xDBE is an IntelliJ-based editor targeted at DBAs and developers working with SQL databases. Andrey Cheptsov, Product Manager for JetBrains, told InfoQ that 0xDBE works with the following databases:&nbsp;DB2, Derby, H2, HSQLDB, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, SQLite and Sybase.</p>
<p>Some of the most important features of 0xDBE are:</p>
<ul> 
 <li>Code completion for foreign keys, alter statements, inserts</li> 
 <li>Parameter suggestions for values, functions and procedures</li> 
 <li>Symbol renaming in data source and SQL files</li> 
 <li>Finding symbols in data source and SQL files</li> 
 <li>Detecting errors in SQL code, offering the option to add unresolved table/columns to a data source</li> 
 <li>SQL Editor with multiple carets, toggled comments, etc.</li> 
 <li>Code formatting based on user-defined styles</li> 
 <li>Table Editor</li> 
 <li>Code navigation to declaration, symbol, etc.</li> 
 <li>Schema Editor that can be used to edit tables, indices, foreign keys, functions, procedures, etc.</li> 
</ul>
<p>0xDBE runs on Windows, OS X&nbsp;and Linux. Those interested can access the <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/dbe/eap/">Early Access Program</a>, while the GA is expected for the end of the year, according to Cheptsov.</p>
<p>When&nbsp;asked if 0xDBE will be enhanced to work with NoSQL databases, Cheptsov said that “NoSQL is also interesting for us, but SQL is the top priority for now.”</p><br><br><br><br><br><br></body></html>
