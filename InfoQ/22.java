<p>Thoughtworks intends for companies to <a href="http://consultantsmind.com/2012/07/01/maturity-model/">use the maturity model to identify gaps</a> in their processes and tools so they can focus on improving those areas. They believe that continuous delivery is the solution to improving the productivity of software development to the point of exceeding expectations and in turn creating the capabilities within technology departments so that they can play a critical role in the strategic direction of their companies. The following levels and results are explained in detail within the white paper:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>5: Optimizing - <a href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/06/why-continuous-deployment.html">Continuous deployment</a> capability enables business innovation/experimentation</li> 
 <li>4: quantitatively managed - Software is always in a releasable state. Release time box is well defined and equal to, or less than, business need.</li> 
 <li>3: defined - Release time box is well defined, but duration from idea inception to production release is greater than business need.</li> 
 <li>2: managed - Release time box is well defined, but duration from idea inception to production release is greater than business need.</li> 
 <li>1: initial - Ad hoc deployments</li> 
</ul>

 The maturity model is divided into 5 levels. Companies that do not exceed level 4 will be hard pressed to deliver innovation at an acceptable pace. Most companies that operate at or below level 3 will never keep up with the demands of business leaders and the market.

 Thoughtworks commissioned Forrester Consulting to perform research for their whitepaper, which included the surveying of 325 business and IT professionals.
