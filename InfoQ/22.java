The conference was a seminal event for the Agile community in Southeast Asia.&nbsp; <br /> <br /> <a href="http://mccarthyshow.com">Jim McCarthy</a> and <a href="http://devjam.com">David Hussman</a> gave keynotes and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/kentlbeck">Kent Beck</a>'s session was so popular it was moved to the keynote auditorium.</p>
<p><a href="http://gilb.com">Tom Gilb</a>, <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/index.jsp?blogger=kevlin">Kevlin Henney</a> and <a href="http://odd-e.com">Bas Vodde</a> were some of the other 26 session speakers.</p>
<p>Discussion and networking opportunities were plentiful, with 400 participants from 21 countries exchanging ideas and sharing experiences throughout the two-day event.</p>
<p>Jim McCarthy opened proceedings with a passionate keynote on Culture Design and the coming era of magnificence. He expressed a strong conviction that multi-cultural teams are essential to delivering a great product. He took the conference as evidence of &quot;East meeting West in a vivid example of the triumphant post-national Software Culture's initial flowering everywhere in the world.&quot;&nbsp; Jim took the audience by surprise by painting a vision in which Singapore could be the birthplace of the software renaissance.</p>
<p>In his very personal talk on &quot;Ease at Work&quot; Kent Beck astonished attendees by declaring he is not the best programmer at Facebook by a long shot, but he is comfortable in his skin and proud of his work.&nbsp; Kent pinpointed key thoughts and experiences demonstrating his professional attitude to producing software. He expressed a strong opinion that any energy invested into creating a false image of oneself is wasted. He boldly stated</p>
<blockquote> 
 <p>&quot;That is why my work matters. My code works. I make public commitments. I am accountable.&quot;</p> 
</blockquote>
<p>In his closing keynote address, David Hussman called on the audience to take Frank Zappa's challenge to &quot;Shut Up and Play Yer Guitar&quot;.&nbsp; He meant it is time to stop talking about process adherence and start focusing on product delivery.&nbsp; </p>
<p>David spoke about selecting tools that foster measurable outcomes such as product sales or market change.</p>
