<p>Ryan spoke to InfoQ about the survey and his thinking behind launching it:</p> 
<p><strong>InfoQ: Please tell us a bit about yourself and the survey</strong>&nbsp;</p> 
<blockquote>
 <span style="font-family:">I've been a software developer going on 12 years in a wide range of vertical markets. &nbsp;Having experienced both exciting, successful projects and bound-to-fail marches, I decided 3 years ago to explore the theory and principles that were needed to replicate the successful ones with more regularity. &nbsp;As a Microsoft ALM MVP I had the opportunity to join the Scrum.org community. &nbsp;I've since spent time learning from Scrum co-founder Ken Schwaber, providing Scrum.org Professional Scrum Foundations and Professional Scrum Developer training, and mentoring numerous teams and organizations through Agile adoptions. &nbsp;This past year I made my way back to product development with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.appliedis.com/">Applied Information Sciences</a>&nbsp;where I'm able to cash in on my learning alongside incredibly smart individuals around the world all while staying close to home with our growing family.</span>
 <o:p></o:p> 
 <p><span style="font-family:">The&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Release Cadence Report itself is an independent effort of mine, though my employer has certainly supported me along the way. &nbsp;The effort was spurred by an&nbsp;</span><a href="https://twitter.com/cromwellryan/status/215469024878931968" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">offhanded tweet</a><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;regarding the current Agile reporting and discourse. &nbsp;I believe the industry has largely moved beyond asking if Agile is the place to be. We now need tools for adopting it's principles effectively. &nbsp;This survey and publication is my contribution to the community in an attempt to refocus the Agile discussion on &quot;working software as the primary measure of progress.&quot;</span></p> 
</blockquote> 
<p><strong>InfoQ: Why are you running the survey, what is the issue or problem you want to investigate?&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<blockquote>
 <span style="font-family:">For the past several years I've had the opportunity to guide a number of organizations as they work towards reaching Agility. &nbsp;In the beginning things are generally amazing. &nbsp;New levels of collaboration and transparency lead to a shared excitement and motivation. &nbsp;Increments of high quality software are produced given the information known at the time. The struggle often comes in answering the question: Are we ready to ship? &nbsp;</span>
 <o:p></o:p> 
 <p><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Answering this question is not simply about accumulated functionality. &nbsp;Releasing validates choices in architecture, user experience, feature selection, operations and an unknown number of other small assumptions made along the way. &nbsp;There are also the assertions made by Daniel Pink in his book&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1594484805" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><i>Drive</i></a><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;that only come true when our creations are in the hands of end users.</span></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:"><a href="http://www.leanessays.com/2011/07/how-cadence-determines-process.html">Mary Poppendieck</a>&nbsp;suggested not long ago that the interval between releases significantly differentiated the development organizations they worked with. &nbsp;While I and the rest of the industry have interesting anecdotal stories about the positive influence of releasing frequently, Release Cadence Report aims to bring empirical data to the discussion.</span></p> 
</blockquote> 
<p><strong>InfoQ: Why is it named the Release Cadence Report?</strong></p> 
<blockquote>
 The term Cadence has been used by a few of the respected Lean/Agile minds such as the&nbsp;
 <a href="http://www.leanessays.com/2011/07/how-cadence-determines-process.html">Poppendiecks</a>,&nbsp;
 <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/agileFluency.html#Two-starTeamsDeliverOnTheMarketx2019sCadence">Diana Larsen and James Shore</a>&nbsp;to describe the rhythm of releasing new software. &nbsp; &nbsp;At the same time that I was finalizing my plans for this effort I was re-reading Brian Harry's post on the&nbsp;
 <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bharry/archive/2012/08/28/tfs-shipping-cadence.aspx">shipping cadence of Microsoft Visual Studio and Team Foundation Server</a>&nbsp;in which he mentions shipping every 3 weeks. &nbsp;This was the topic I was trying to bring attention too. &nbsp;In the end, my hope is that this effort can help make the term and concept of Release Cadence as natural a part of the Agile discussion as TDD and User Story.

<p><strong>InfoQ:What is the focus of the questions – what areas are you examining?</strong></p> 
<blockquote> 
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:">Certainly the most important set of questions include how frequently your IT organization is releasing software to customers. &nbsp;Around that information we are focusing on&nbsp;five areas:</span>
  <o:p></o:p></p> 
 <ul type="disc"> 
  <li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:
    ">Market Capability</span>
   <o:p></o:p></li> 
  <li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:
    ">Employee Satisfaction</span>
   <o:p></o:p></li> 
  <li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:
    ">Organizational Composition</span>
   <o:p></o:p></li> 
  <li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:
    ">Methodologies &amp; Frameworks</span>
   <o:p></o:p></li> 
  <li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:
    ">Patterns, Practices, and Techniques</span>
   <o:p></o:p></li> 
 </ul> 
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:">We believe this will help us create a clear picture of what the industry looks like on the scale of release cadences. &nbsp;We'd also like to make clear what practices are being used successfully so that informed decisions can be made about what might prove successful elsewhere.</span></p> 
</blockquote> 
<p><strong>InfoQ: When will the survey be completed?</strong></p> 
<blockquote> 
 <span style="font-family:">The survey period is scheduled to close on May 24th, 2013. &nbsp;We'll then take a few months to analyze and prepare our free community report. &nbsp;We anticipate the Release Cadence Report being published in early fall 2013. &nbsp;Those who complete the survey or refer responses will receive an early copy of the publication in appreciation of the time and participation.</span>
</blockquote> 
<p><strong>InfoQ:Do you have any early results, or are there any trends you’re currently seeing from the results so far?</strong></p> 
<blockquote>
 <span style="font-family:">We have certainly seen quite a bit of interest in the survey. &nbsp;We're seeing a wide range of results come through, but no trends that we're ready to share quite yet. &nbsp;We'd like to make sure that those contributing are sharing their real experiences and are not influenced by incomplete results.</span>
</blockquote> 
<p><strong>InfoQ: When and where will the results be published?</strong></p> 
<blockquote>
 <span style="font-family:">Those who have completed the survey should expect to receive an early copy of the report by email. &nbsp;We appreciate their time and willingness to contribute to the community. &nbsp;Once that early period is over, the remainder of the community will be able to download the 2013 Release Cadence Report at&nbsp;<a href="http://releasecadencereport.com/">http://releasecadencereport.com</a>.</span>
</blockquote> 
<p><strong>InfoQ: Will the raw data from the survey be available for others to conduct analysis?</strong></p> 
<blockquote>
 <span style="font-family:">Partners who refer a certain level of survey responses will have deeper access to the survey data. Partners can read more and sign up at&nbsp;<a href="http://releasecadencereport.com/partnerships/">http://releasecadencereport.com/partnerships/</a>. &nbsp;To be clear, we will never make available emails or other identifying information from the survey such as email domains. This includes all partners.</span>
 <o:p></o:p> 
 <p><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">There has been some consideration towards making 2014 Release Cadence Report data available under a Creative Commons license. &nbsp;For 2013, our plans only include producing the free community report.</span></p>
