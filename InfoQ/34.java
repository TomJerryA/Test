Dating back to the company's early days, PHP has powered many of the company's offerings. One of PHP's strengths is that it is a dynamic language well-suited to rapid prototyping, but this same attribute tends to complicate the development and maintenance of large code bases. To address these concerns, Facebook has released Hack, a new programming language intended to maintain PHP's strengths while augmenting this with what they call gradual-typing and several new language features.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">This use of gradual typing means in Hack dynamic and statically-type code can inter-operate in the same file. This lets existing PHP code be converted to Hack according to the needs of each project it is used in without requiring a large up-front conversion cost. To assist with a PHP to Hack migration, Facebook is providing <a href="http://docs.hhvm.com/manual/en/install.hack.conversion.php">conversion tools</a>. Hack itself works by monitoring your source file as you edit it. A system daemon monitors your local filesystem, and when changes are saved to disk a type checker will quickly analyze the changes. Facebook indicates that this turnaround averages 200ms and should rarely exceed 60 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Hack isn't just bringing typing characteristics, it is also providing several additional language features. These include type annotations, nullable types, generics, collections, and lambdas. The Hack language <a href="http://docs.hhvm.com/manual/en/hack.intro.php">reference</a> provides full details on all features currently available. Just like the PHP code at Facebook, <a href="http://hacklang.org/">Hack</a> runs on Facebook's Hip Hop Virtual Machine (<a href="http://hhvm.com/">HVVM</a>) which uses just-in-time compilation to boost program performance.</p>
