Agile has the manifesto and principles, it focuses on people,&nbsp;clarity for the stakeholders,&nbsp;faster delivery, and happier customers, so&nbsp;why would you need DevOps? In his talk at the <a href="http://www.conferences.unicom.co.uk/agileincomplexenvironments/">Agile Methods in the Finance Sector and Complex Environment</a> conference, John explained what DevOps is and what it has brought&nbsp;to their business.</p>
<p>Nokia Entertainment were practicing agile software development, but still had a release schedule of 3 months.&nbsp;Seeking a way to deliver faster they looked to see if DevOps could help them, as described&nbsp;by John in the InfoQ DevOps War story <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/monthly-devops-01-nokia">DevOps @ Nokia Entertainment</a>.&nbsp; If DevOps really has value, I want to understand it, and be able&nbsp;to grow it said John. But like growing a plant, I need to understand the conditions it needs, and those may be different to Agile.</p>
<p>In many organizations tensions separate IT Operations and Development, like:</p>
<ul> 
 <li>Stability vs Change</li> 
 <li>Operations Culture vs Dev Culture</li> 
</ul>
<p>If these tensions weren’t enough, both groups have their own unique technical challenges.</p>
<p>Nokia Entertainment wanted to create a culture of collaboration and trust, which made it possible to share knowledge and responsibility. They&nbsp;gave attention to&nbsp;the people aspects to create change in this organization that would be durable and long lasting.</p>
<p>Along with other initiatives, like Continuous Delivery, DevOps has improved&nbsp;speed of execution from end to end to Nokia Entertainment, they became able to deliver&nbsp;twice as fast.&nbsp;Doing&nbsp;DevOps didn’t bring stability AND change, but it helped them to find a balance between the two.&nbsp; It helped them to improve quality, cost and efficiency, and increase product&nbsp;reliability with the early involvement of IT operations.&nbsp; These approaches helped&nbsp;motivation by bringing more autonomy, and a focus on mastery. Generally this has improved engagement of employees.&nbsp;Many organizations report that a strong DevOps culture also helps them to attract and retain personnel.</p>
<p>Another way DevOps&nbsp;differs from&nbsp;agile&nbsp;is by being&nbsp;driven by a community of enthusiasts. Time will tell if that is a good or bad thing, said John. For now, DevOps is a neat package, a pattern for some common but difficult problems in delivering software. Focusing on culture and sharing has delivered&nbsp;results for Nokia Entertainment, it will be interesting to see if this continues.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br></body></html>
