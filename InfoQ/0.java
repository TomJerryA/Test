 <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="Standard"><a href="http://status.modern.ie/">status.modern.IE</a> provides a detailed directory of various web browser features and web standards, such as <code>&lt;datalist&gt; </code>, <code>&lt;img srcset&gt;</code>, and Application Cache.&nbsp; The site contains information on Firefox, Chrome, Safari and IE— and so it is easy to see how well each feature is supported.&nbsp; For example, the <code>&lt;datalist&gt;</code> element is supported on IE10+, Chrome, and Firefox but not currently supported by Safari.&nbsp; Where applicable, links to more information on a particular element or standard are provided to MSDN, webplatform.org, and w3.org.
 <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="Standard">The directory is not limited to just listing a catalog of features, it is possible to search for a particular item or to filter based on the browsers that need to be supported by your particular web application.&nbsp; Need to see what is available if IE8, IE9, and Chrome browsers are required?&nbsp; Adjust the filter accordingly (naturally the IE8 requirement greatly limits what advanced options are available).&nbsp; The filter also allows for searching by whether or not a feature is in development or under consideration, providing guidance as to when it will be available.
 <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="Standard">The full source code for the Node.js project serving this data is available on the <a href="https://github.com/InternetExplorer/Status.IE">project’s GitHub</a> page.&nbsp; The data itself is also available as a JSON document under <a href="http://status.modern.ie/features">http://status.modern.IE/features</a> providing an alternate way to access the information.
 <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="Standard">Some work remains for additional improvement, as when a feature is listed as “under consideration” or “not currently planned”, no timeline is presented for when it will be completed or re-evaluated respectively.&nbsp; Another limitation of the filter is that it is currently not possible to filter by date, so that only new(er) features could be reviewed.
