<p><strong>InfoQ: Can you share with us the real purpose and benefit of XAML Spy?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  The ultimate purpose of XAML Spy is to save time. XAML Spy provides developers with a unique insight 'under the hood' of their XAML app at runtime. XAML Spy helps developers to understand how their XAML apps really work and helps in quickly identifying possible issues. By providing tools for quickly identifying issues, developer productivity is definitely improved.

<p><strong>InfoQ: Can you share us the few scenarios where XAML Spy can be used?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  Scenario 1 - Understand how and why visuals are rendered. XAML Spy provides a real-time view of the application's user interface visual tree, with access to all properties of any visual
 <br /> 
 <br /> Scenario 2 - Full filesystem access to the app storage. Most XAML apps come with isolated storage on local disk. It's fairly hard to access the folder and files in this storage. XAML Spy makes it super easy to access and modify the files of the isolated storage.
 <br /> 
 <br /> Scenario 3 - Performance monitors help identify possible memory and rendering issues. 
 <br /> 
 <br /> Scenario 4 - The automation visual tree aids in learning how a XAML app manifests itself to accessibility apps (such as screen readers and other automation tools).
