<p>The recently developed <a href="http://www.theleanstartup.com/">Lean Startup</a> methodology, combined with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">agile software development practices</a> upon which it is heavily based, answers our problems.</p>
<p>However, most startups apply the principles in a fragmented way and do not get the expected benefits (<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390443720204578004980476429190.html">three out of four startups fail)</a>.</p>
<p>To more easily understand the core concepts and value of Lean Startup, we present the martial art of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_jiu-jitsu">Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu</a> (BJJ) as a metaphor that can teach how to run a startup the lean way.</p>
<p>If you feel you’ve already mastered lean startups, use this article to introduce yourself to the martial art about which President Theodore Roosevelt <a href="http://www.artofjiujitsu.com/blog/the-art-of-jiu-jitsu-is-worth-more-in-every-way-than-all-of-our-athletics-combined--president-theodore-roosevelt">said</a>, &quot;The art of Jiu-Jitsu is worth more in every way than all of our athletics combined.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_Startup">Lean Startup</a>, following principles from lean manufacturing and agile development, is a way to develop products, iteratively and incrementally, in an environment full of risk. It was proposed in 2011 by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Ries">Eric Ries</a> and is based on <a href="http://steveblank.com/category/customer-development/">customer development</a>, business-hypothesis-driven experimentation, and continuous validated learning.</p>
<div id="lowerFullwidthVCR"></div>
<p>Both systems trace their roots to Japanese culture: the lean startup to the Toyota production system and BJJ to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jujutsu">jiu-jitsu</a>, the art of samurais. Both apply the core concept of “minimum effort for maximum efficiency” and implement the “conservation of energy” principle, which is the primary deciding factor for every fight in any aspect of life.</p>

<p>A lean startup should connect with its initial users (earlyvangelists or early adopters) to track how they use the product/service it offers. Every new feature should be discovered and designed based on customer reaction. <b>Otherwise, it’s like trying to fight an invisible opponent</b>. We already have at our disposal the necessary techniques (<a href="http://steveblank.com/category/customer-development/">customer development</a>, <a href="http://leananalyticsbook.com/">lean analytics</a>) and the corresponding customer-behavior and usage-analytics tools (Google Analytics, KissMetrics, MixPanel, Crazy Egg, Flurry), which help us to monitor and analyze everything about our users. Assuming we have this information, what is our strategy and how we decide our next move?</p>

   <td valign="top" width="400"><font style="background-color: #cccccc"><a href="http://jiujitsubrotherhood.com/how-jiu-jitsu-works/">What differentiates Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu from most martial arts is the employment of positional strategy</a>, which, independently of the opponent, is divided in three main phases: control, dominate, and submit. Before all, you must control your opponent. Next, try to penetrate his basic line of defense (the guard) to take a dominant position (side control, mount him, or get his back). From there, you can attempt to make him submit. Every stage has its own philosophy and approach and you must follow this exact path, with no exceptions, otherwise you risk defeat. </font></td>

<p>Similarly, a lean startup must find ways to “control” its early adopters by establishing a special relationship with them with different methods and communication channels such as marketing, online feedback, rewards, etc. It must interact with them often, engaging them to reveal their reactions and accept their valuable input about the experiments it runs. Several tools can help, like Survey.io, Mailchimp, Uservoice etc. <b>These early adopters are a startup's most valuable asset. It must strongly grip them, making it extremely difficult for them to disconnect</b>.</p>

<p><b>A startup’s dominant position simply translates to achieving product/market fit. </b></p>
<p>It must continuously execute small experiments<b> </b>(testing and pivoting) to discover those product features providing real value. <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/05/test-everything/">Split testing</a> and <a href="http://www.pretotyping.org/">pretotyping</a> help in this approach. During this effort, progress must not be measured by the total number of features pushed but by how much we improve our position (how much closer we have come to p/m fit). We measure this with specific customer-activation and retention metrics (<a href="http://practicetrumpstheory.com/2009/11/how-i-am-measuring-productmarket-fit/">how-i-am-measuring-productmarket-fit/</a>). <b>Functionality without our awareness and value for the customers is wasted movement, uselessly spending our energy</b>.</p>

<p>Sustainable growth on a massive scale is the final destination of a startup. To achieve this, a new role of <b>growth hacker </b>has emerged. A growth hacker’s mission, according to Patrick Vlaskovits, author of the NYT bestseller <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Lean-Entrepreneur-Visionaries-Products/dp/111829534X">The Lean Entrepreneur</a>, is “<a href="http://vlaskovits.com/2012/07/youre-a-growth-rookie-not-a-growth-hacker/">to deliver huge and exponential growth in users/leads/sales</a>”. Richie Hecker, founder of Bootstrapper, <a href="http://techzulu.com/5-reasons-growth-hacking-is-the-most-important-function-of-a-startup/">says</a> growth hacker “...is the most important role because this person, by enabling new ways to create a scalable customer acquisition process, graduates a company from startup to viable long-term business.”</p>
<p>A startup should not try to grow its user base before product/market fit, because that will only consume resources without much benefit. In parallel with growth efforts, although a startup will probably make adjustments to the value proposition, it must be careful not to lose its dominant position of product/market fit.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The startup game is a positional game with disciplined strategy (control-dominate-submit) that above all requires conservation of energy and agility. Agility is the ability of the team to change directions without<font color="#ff0000"> </font><font color="#000000">losing balance, strength, and speed<u>.</u> It is a primary success factor.</font></p>
<p>In an another article, we will show how team agility can be developed, measured and maintained through proper training and an agile coach.</p>
<p>Adopt a survival mindset, try to avoid mistakes, and sooner or later your users will give you the opportunity to win them as lifelong customers. As Helio Gracie, one of the founders of BJJ, said,<b> “I never defeated my opponents, they defeated themselves.”</b></p>
