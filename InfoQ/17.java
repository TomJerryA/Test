<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">The browser-based test management area of VS2012 receives further refinement with the ability to edit text for results and test case steps inline, without requiring software to be installed in the environment being tested.</p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Note that the go-live status of CTP4 applies to Team Foundation Server 2012 <u>exclusively</u>. This is not true of CTP4 for VS2012, and as a result CTP4 for VS2012 should not be applied to production environments.</p>
