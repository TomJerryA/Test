These tools can be used to target SQL Server 2005, SQL Server 2008, SQL Server 2008 R2, SQL Server 2012 and SQL Azure.</p> 
<p lang="zxx" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Installing the SSDT BI package will provide the ability to create projects based on the following templates: analysis, reporting, and integration services. Once installed, new templates appear under the category of Business Intelligence:</p>

<p lang="zxx" style="margin-bottom: 0in">What do these SQL Server Data Tools enable users to do? Microsoft describes them as follows:</p> 
<blockquote> 
 <p lang="zxx" style="margin-bottom: 0in">&quot;Developers will also appreciate the familiar VS tools we bring to database development, specifically; code navigation, IntelliSense, language support that parallels what is available for C# and VB, platform-specific validation, debugging and declarative editing in the TSQL Editor, as well as a visual Table Designer for both database projects and online database instances.&quot;</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p lang="zxx" style="margin-bottom: 0in">This latest edition of the tools does support project support <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/sqlrsteamblog/archive/2013/03/06/sql-server-data-tools-business-intelligence-for-visual-studio-2012-released-online.aspx">round-tripping</a>, so users can upgrade to 2012 and still interoperate with 2010-based files. Users of the Express editions of VS2012 can also install BI alongside their current installation. Another expected feature is that this release brings the toolset into alignment with the VS2012 GUI shell.</p>

<p lang="zxx" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Office Developer Tools</b></p> 
<p lang="zxx" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Not to be outdone, the Office team has also released <a href="http://aka.ms/OfficeDevToolsForVS2012">developer tools</a> (note link is to installer) for VS2012. These tools enable developers to create apps for Office and SharePoint. Among the new features, this <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vsto/archive/2013/03/06/office-developer-tools-for-visual-studio-2012-now-available.aspx">latest release</a> supports .NET Framework 4.5 to enable building apps for Office 2013 and the ability to remotely debug a SharePoint site. Developers who previously manually created <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vsto/archive/2012/12/21/creating-a-bootstrapper-package-for-an-office-2013-vsto-add-in-with-visual-studio-2012.aspx">bootstrapper packages</a> to provide .NET 4.5 functionality no longer need do so with this release. Note that unlike the BI tools above, the Office Developer Tools require VS2012 Professional or higher.</p>
