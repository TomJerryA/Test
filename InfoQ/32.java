This feature implies that users will view different output in laptop, tablet, smartphone and other similar portable devices by publishing only one version to your website.</p>
<p>The latest release also includes content <a href="http://showme.doctohelp.com/widgetexplorer/">widgets</a> such as Note, Lightbox, Gallery, Carousel, Topic Contents, Tabs and Code Highlighter. They are blocks of editable and interactive content that you can insert in your source files in the HTML5 content editor.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://showme.doctohelp.com/widgetexplorer/index.html#!Documents/LightBox.htm">Lightbox</a> widget displays images as thumbnails and upon clicking a modal dialog will appear with the image in original size. On the other hand, <a href="http://showme.doctohelp.com/widgetexplorer/index.html#!Documents/Carousel.htm">Carousel</a> shows the images in a self-contained slide show and the Gallery widget will showcase the images with a strip of thumbnails so that you can select the image you want to open without spending too much time on navigation.</p>
<p>The newly introduced topic contents widget will enable users to navigate long topics easily with the help of a linked table of contents. While the <a href="http://showme.doctohelp.com/widgetexplorer/index.html#!Documents/Tabs.htm">tabs</a> widget enables you to organize information in tabbed style interface, code highlighter is used to add code snippets in your help documentation. It also contains Copy Code button which enables users to copy the snippet to the clipboard.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br></body></html>
